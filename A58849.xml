            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>One Occaſion given me was the multitude and variety of the like Books ſet forth by other Churches, whereby not only the perſons under them, were trained up in the Knowledge and Faith profeſſed there, but the minds of many of our Church were prepoſſeſſed, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſwayed by ſuch Doctrines, which ſeemed to me as forreign in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as place, to thoſe of our Church, and the Ancient.</p>
            <p>I could have here given the Reader the names of above fourty Tractates of this nature, many of which have been tranſlated into the Engliſh Tongue, to the corrupting of weaker judgments.

               <pb facs="tcp:55232:3"/>And as the great number of forreign Books have incited me, ſo the Paucity of the like, in, and from our Church, hath no leſs embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened me to undertake this.

               </note> a great admirer of him. Baxter (ſaith he) <hi>is of all men leaſt addicted to any reſolute opinions, being one that favoureth not more the Presbyterians than the Independents; neither is he ſharp againſt the Epiſcopal Party, but between them, and doubtful what ſide to take, except in the cauſe of God, and holineſs of Life.</hi> The greateſt part of which Character is but too true: being as much with me, as if he had ſaid, <hi>He were of no Religion at all.</hi> For however <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Cartwrights</hi> opinions of a certain and definite Diſcipline Eſsentially requiſite to a Church, as a Church is to Chriſtian Religion, be by Puritans laid aſide for the preſent: and like embers buried up in the Aſh-heap till they ſhall riſe again next day, and kindle a new fire; and now nothing but <hi>Get Chriſt, Purity of Ordinances,</hi> is notorious amongſt them, to the Vulgar; yet when people are deceived by that, they call <hi>Pure and Powerful Preaching of Chriſt</hi> into new Societies of their <hi>own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture;</hi> then preſently doth moſt apparent Reaſon and inevitable Neceſſity constrain them to invent, and impoſe new Covenants and Bonds to conſerve them in their new Fraternities, contrary altogether to that General Liberty before propounded and promiſed them. No more
<pb facs="tcp:55232:3"/>
than doth the charm of Christian Liberty ſound in their ears. No more of the free uſe of Indifferent things, ſo contrary to the Decrees and Practiſe of a Church, but then come into credit again ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe; <hi>There muſt be Order: There muſt be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: There muſt be unity in the Church:</hi> dealing herein with poor ſimple Chriſtians, as men do with their horſe they would take up, carrying in one hand provender, which they ſhow him, and make a great noiſe with, and behind them in the other hand, a bridle to hold him faſt to them, and ride him as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be of no regulated determinate Society or Church, adheres to no particular Communion, ſubmits to no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Governours in ſpecial, but to all, or any, as it ſhould ſeem, be must bear it as well as he can, when he bears himſelf (not out of paſſion or envie at his new and ſingular device of going to heaven, but juſtice and reaſon) cenſur'd for a man of no Religion at all, or if any, of his own making: which teaches him to perſevere in that fond and haughty deſign he once had, when he took upon him to <hi>top</hi> his Brethren of the Miniſtery in the Weſtern Parts, and to frame Grounds and Aphoriſms for both Civil and Eccleſiastical Politie of his own; with as little judgment and humility as ſafety to the Church and State: as if he had aim'd at nothing ſo much, as to be according to forreign Phraſe and Preſidents, an <hi>Extraordinary Paſtor;</hi> without any Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal or Rule, but from himſelf: but failing of this, he now thinks it best to become an <hi>Extraordinary Sheep;</hi> of all, and no fold; writing Books as uncertain and contrary, as himſelf, on all ſides and for all Palates: as if he had found out the Univerſal Character for Religions, like to that of Languages; in which all men doing as he wou'd have them, ſhou'd agree in going to Heaven. And now all that lately and moſt officious and ſerviceable method of mounting our ſelves, and cruſhing and trampling on the necks of others, and them our Governours, by moſt unjuſt and cruel acts, moſt falſe and bitter language, must be laid aſide, and thrown overboard, as the Turks did their <hi>Cemiters,</hi> when they loſt the day at the battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> not becauſe they liked them not, but becauſe they could do them no more ſervice; and leaſt they ſhould come into the Chriſtians hands, and be uſed against them. So indeed Sectaries now-a-dayes call for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and moderation on all hands, caſting away that unchristian
<pb facs="tcp:55232:4"/>
language which ſtood them in ſo much ſtead againſt them they reſolved to destroy, not without horrible Succeſs.</p>
            <p>And yet we ſee, while they call ſo charitably for moderation, and would have no revilings of them that differ in opinions only; their churliſh nature and virulent tongues, cannot forget their wonted ſtrains of diſhonesty and extream ſpite and railings: witneſs one for all, the foreſaid <hi>Ludovicus Molinaeus;</hi> who, as civilly and reverently as he carries himſelf towards Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (for none of his vertues we may be ſure) as exorbitantly in the old Puritans language, and on their Grounds, flies in the face of the Greateſt and Best of the Rulers of the Church and State too: who have at any time reſolutely oppoſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Schiſmatical devices of ſuch unchristian Reformers as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: only I muſt confeſs he is favourable to his late Sacred Majeſty, whoſe invincible Piety and unparallel'd innocency of Life, and Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, yet Glorious Death, hath not only ſtruck Sectaries dumb, who once opened ſo loudly and perniciouſly against him, but extorted cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations from them: not much unlike that approbation given by that Parricide <hi>Antonius</hi> the Emperor, who when he underſtood how the people of <hi>Rome</hi> magnified, and even de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Let him be Divine ſo he be not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> But whom doth he, or his Fellows (occaſion ſerving) spare? Hath he not raked the stinking Canal of all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ld lyes and feigned ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors invented to imbroyl the Church in Schiſm, and Kingdome in Sedition and Bloud, and indeavoured to put new life into them, and Authentize them to other Countries as well as ours?</p>
            <p>It was ſoberly and ſeaſonably ſaid by that excellent Arch-biſhop<note place="margin">Speech Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Star Chamber p. 2.</note> (whom he would traduce in baſest manner, were not his merits above the Calumnies of ſuch wretched Fellows) in his Speech in the <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,</hi> at the Charge of <hi>Prin, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick, viz. There were times when Perſecutions were great in the Church, even to exceed Barbarity it ſelf: Did any Martyr or Confeſſor in thoſe times Libel their Governors? Surely no; not one of them to my beſt remembrance: yet theſe complain of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution without all ſhew of cauſe; and in the mean time, libel and rail without all meaſure: ſo little a kin are they to thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſt, or the leaſt part of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> This witneſs is moſt true of theſe Cretians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55232:4"/>And it is my great glory, not only to be named among ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons as lately, but at preſent are living in our Church, whom this <hi>Molinaeus</hi> traduceth. And why ſo? becauſe of my rude uſage of Mr. <hi>Daillee,</hi> whom <hi>I ſpit on</hi> (if any will believe him)<note place="margin">Lud. Molin. Antidure. Epiſt. p. 54.</note> 
               <hi>rather then diſpute againſt: That I ſpare not the memory of</hi> Diodate: <hi>That I am no fairer to Mr.</hi> Bochartus. And why doth be forget my railing too againſt his Brethren the Puritans? This he might better ſay. But neither he nor any man elſe can ſay that I imitate Puritans, in railing against my Betters or Governors: that's their peculiar and inſeparable virtue; and hath been from the firſt founding of the Diſcipline by <hi>Penrie, Whittingham, Goodman,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> with others, to the confounding of the Church, ſo far as lay in their power. I ever was not only an approver, but an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the perſonal Gifts of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> of Monſieur <hi>Daillee,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Bochart, &amp;c.</hi> but I owe them no more reſpect in the cauſe of Religion than they do me, or any man elſe of our Church: but I profeſs I owe more Reverence to the least of the Biſhops and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, whom Puritans have ſo baſely treated, then to the greatest of them; and ſo do Sectaries too, as ill as they are galled to hear of it.</p>
            <p>But what, do I ſpeak ſo irreverently (after all) againſt Mr. <hi>Dail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee?</hi> Not a word hath this Zelote found in my whole Book againſt him, nor in that <hi>Action</hi> againſt our Schiſmaticks, whom I confeſs to have ſeverely treated, in that I give them <hi>their own;</hi> ſome mens dealings being ſo foul (as theirs have been) that the very bare reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them is lookt on as railing, though never ſo faithfully done. If any of them, or their friends, can tell me wherein I have done them wrong, in miſreporting their Facts, I do here aſſure them I will make them all the ſatisfaction I am able, in retracting and acknowledging my Error, and that as publickly as I have injured them, with the next opportunity. <hi>Cyprian, Optatus, Hierom, Auſtin, Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (as holy and ſober perſons as they were in their Generations) made no great ſcruple to paint Schiſmaticks out in their Colors, with language which cuts where it goes: and I am ſure theſe upon no better grounds than they have, or can poſſibly offer, of departing from, and dividing our Church, are no better. Nay, in this hath the Puritan Sectary tranſcended all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks that ever

went before them. For though divers Factions were raiſed and fomented to a great height in the Church of God of old, and <hi>Altar</hi> was erected against <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>Chair</hi> againſt <hi>Chair (i. e.)</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip againſt Worſhip, and Governor againſt Governor of the Church; yet do we find none, through all the Hiſtories of the Church, that ever became ſo preſumptuous and deſperate, as to endeavour the total ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government of the Church in it ſelf, and to ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the room of it, quite of another nature, which we read not that <hi>Aerius</hi> himſelf ever attempted, though he preacht up the equality of Biſhops and Presbyters. And ſo far am I from ſuch a spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (I confeſs) that I ſhall never ſmooth them, or their cauſe over ſo civilly, as to imply the contrary, until they bethink themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their customary frauds and diſſimulations, of their duties, and return to the Peace and Unitie of the Church; which I ſhall not ceaſe to pray for.</p>
            <p>But one of the moſt material things charged on me is, That <hi>I liked</hi> Dailee's <hi>Book the worſe becauſe it pleaſed the Puritans ſo much:</hi> which (ſays my Accuſer) is to be of the ſpirit of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> the Jeſuite. But he is mistaken. For <hi>Maldonate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rejected a ſenſe of Scripture which otherwiſe he approved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was <hi>Calvins.</hi> If I diſliked <hi>Dailees opinions</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>Dailees,</hi> or our Puritans, he had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near the matter; but no ſuch thing hath fallen from me. I diſliked indeed his Book, becauſe it ſo far pleaſed the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, that they were thereby notably confirmed in their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Opinions againſt the Authority of the Ancient, and our Preſent Church. Here were evil effects alſo to be diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
            <p>Next let us bear how I abuſe <hi>Diodate</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe this ſaying of him againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt: <hi>viz. That Chriſt in the Goſpel commands us to forgive our enemies, but not our friends.</hi> This he calls <hi>Craſſum mendacium, A groſs lye in me;</hi> whereas the lye (if there be any) muſt neceſſarily be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his brother Puritan, <hi>Cook</hi> the Sollicitor, againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, at his Sentence in that monſtrous Court. For I no where ſay of my ſelf, that <hi>Diodate</hi> ſaid thoſe words, but I ſaid that <hi>Cook</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them as heard from <hi>Diodates</hi> own mouth: and I there give him
<pb facs="tcp:55232:5"/>
the very Page where thoſe words are to be found: and this ſimple Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reller and Vindicator of Puritans, hath no other way to evade this, then by a bold and ſenſleſs denial of the thing ſo apparent.</p>
            <p>Now to that excellently learned perſon <hi>Bochartus,</hi> what is it I ſay againſt him, but that he would needs be medling where it concerns him not; as the too common practiſe hath constantly been both of French and Dutch Divines? What have they to do to interpoſe ſo often and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably in behalf of Puritans as they have? Is it not ſufficient that they are not diſquieted by us in their ſingularities and inconformities to the perpetual conſtitution and orders of Christs Univerſal Church, but they must needs ſeek all occaſions pragmatically to animate Sectaries, to give them counſel and aſſistance, to give them <hi>Communicatory</hi>

            <p>And now becauſe I perceive the Papiſts triumph when they can find ſuch blemiſhes in our Church, and charge it with all theſe, and ſuch like, which they may find among diſſenters, I ſhall ſet down likewiſe their principal accuſations, as I find them collected and ſumm'd up by <hi>Fitz-Simons:</hi>

Yet have I not taken upon me, in an imperious way, to multiply Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Axioms, and impoſe them with expectation of greater faith in them, then ſuch men will allow to the Decrees of the <hi>Holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> ſo called.

anſwered me, <hi>Wollebius.</hi> And farther inquiring, what <hi>Wollebius</hi> ſaid of a certain point, he replyed, as he there found it: againſt which when I put in my exception, he wondered at me, and indeavored to ſilence me, by telling me, <hi>It was a Canon.</hi> I have not here proceeded ſo Canonically as others, nor yet ſo Polemically: but conſidering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Johns</hi> diſtinction, that there are <hi>Children in Chriſt,</hi>

And that to write Polemically for the ſatisfaction of the third, required another more proper language, and a more Scholaſtical Perſon, and much more large Volumes then this one; though this Book hath increaſed under my hands well nigh thrice as much as I at firſt intended. And in truth, it is to be lamented and bluſhed at, that none of the Learned men of our Church have yet appeared in ſo noble and neceſſary a Work, as the fuller and more entire managing of the <hi>Elenctical</hi> part of Divinity, to the preventing daily miſchiefs ariſing from the neceſſity of repairing to our Enemies of both ſides, to perfect Theological Studies, without the due ballance on our ſide to prevent prejudice.

And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Book argues great Learning in the Author, ſo might it have proved no leſs beneficial to the Chriſtian World, had there been leſs complyance with <hi>Calvin</hi> in it: which might be the reaſon that it found not that entertainment in <hi>England,</hi> that otherwiſe it might have had: but was commended and publiſhed to the World by <hi>Andrew Rivett:</hi> the Dutch Divines giving full approbation thereunto: to whom, it ſhould ſeem, declining the judgment of that Church he stood more obliged to, he ſubmitted his Work: which yet might be excuſed in part, it being a time <hi>(viz. 1645.)</hi> when ſuch havock and diſſipation of the Engliſh Church was made by the Calvinizing Scots and Scotizing Engliſh, as were not to be excuſed, nor ever forgotten.</p>
            <p>For mine own particular, I would not have any to expect here a Book of Preaching or Devotion: of both which (and eſpecially the former) there ſeems to be little want amongſt us; ſo neither purely Scholastical, but ſerving to all theſe purpoſes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have wrote it in the Engliſh Tongue, aiming at no higher end, than to profit thoſe of our own Church and Nation: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I call it <hi>An Introduction,</hi> intimating my principal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be, to prepare the way to the Readers aſcent from this, to more high and ample Diſquiſitions: And this farther, <hi>according to the mind of the Church of</hi> England, I ſay this was my Purpoſe: I do not ſay that this I have alwayes exactly and infallibly attained, any more than thoſe Learned Writers before me, who have endeavoured to give us the ſum of the Laws of our Nation, as I have of the Religion of our Church, have attained their ends, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deſires, and therefore much leſs to the expectation of others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Apology, which Learned Dr. <hi>Cowell</hi> uſed to the Reader of his Inſtitutions of the Engliſh Laws, with ſome little variation may aptly enough ſerve my turn against the proneneſs
<pb facs="tcp:55232:14"/>
of ſome Cenſurers whom it may offend, that I take upon me to determine what the Church of <hi>England</hi> holds: when as there is, and alwayes will be, and that in all Churches, ſome Diverſity in the Writers.</p>

For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt be a ſervice, and a tendency to Perfection, and union with God; but the Bleſſed Spirits of Men and Angels are out of their Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip, and imperfect ſtate, and conſummated in that fruition, and reward, and union with God, which they are capable of.

                     <p>ALL Religion ſuppoſeth a Deity; as all Arts and Sciences ſuppoſe their foundation upon which they are built, and not prove it. Yet notwithſtanding for the more effectual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and perſwaſion hereof, and for the due exerciſe of that natural notion of a God, which many times is very weak, for want of uſe (as men ſometimes looſe the uſe of their bodily Limbs for want of due exerciſe of them) we ſhall briefly recount (for methods ſake) ſome of thoſe many demonſtrations of a Divine ſupream Being, which is God: and that by theſe gradations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That there are purer and ſuperiour <hi>Beings</hi> to Man, though not, obvious to any of the five groſs ſenſes of man, may be gathered from the effects ſupernatural to all corporeal Creatures, and ordinarily viſible. Such are the ſuddain and rapid tranſlations of Bodies from one place to another. Such are likewiſe, voices heard without any notice given to the eye of perſons preſent: Such are Apparitions made to diverſe in all ages of Spirits, to perſons, in the likeneſs of Bodies indeed, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55232:22"/>
by their manner of entrance, their manner of motions and actions, their manner of departure and diſappearing, that ſuch forms are only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, to render their preſence more obvious to us. Such are laſtly the many Predictions and Revelations of cloſeſt and deepeſt ſecrets of men, not poſſible to be known but by a preternatural ſubtilty: All which are ſo frequently reported in Hiſtories of all ſorts, Divine and Humane, that who ever will call in queſtion muſt be judged purpoſely to have taken on him ſuch incredulity, that he might deny this thing; ſeeing there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite other things, which upon no greater evidence, he firmly believeth. And what greater abſurdity need a man be forced to than this ſingularity of judging in this cauſe? For can they who reſolve to doubt of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, alledge any ſenſe or demonſtration contrary to this? If they can, Why have they kept it from the World all this while? If they cannot, Why ſhould they not yield to better grounds for it, than they have any againſt it, <hi>Viz.</hi> the concurrent teſtimony of ſo many and ſober perſons affirming the ſame, from their experience?</p>
                     <p>But if this be admitted, then, by due gradations may we eaſily aſcend unto the moſt ſupream Being of all, which is God. No man being able to determine any point which may not be exceeded, until we come to infinity it ſelf. And this preſent viſible World being but a draught of that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>, God was pleaſed to ordain Man to bear his Image in a Supremacy over all earthly Creatures; that from hence we may learn, that as one Creature ſerves another, and all, Man; ſo Man is ſubordinate to Spirits, and created Spirits to God, as their onely abſolute Lord. And therefore in Scripture it is ſaid of them, <hi>They are all Miniſtring Spirits</hi> (i. e. under<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 9. Hebr. 12. 9.</note> God) <hi>to them that believe:</hi> And that he is the <hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> Which neceſſary and harmonious dependence of all things on One, is ſo conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common reaſon of Man, that the contrary, introducing a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or independence, doth withal bring in a manifeſt Anarchy, and confuſion in the Univerſe, repugnant as well to nature as reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the ſeveral Arts and Sciences miniſter ſeveral proofs of this, as might be ſhewn in particular; would it not be too long, and were it not to be found performed by divers already. That taken from the courſe of Nature may here ſuffice. Nature it ſelf, and common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation tell us, that there is diverſity in Cauſe and Effect, and that there is Generation and Corruption; and that nothing in the World can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it ſelf: And (for inſtance) he that lived many thouſand years ago, could no more make himſelf, then he that lived but yeſterday, or was born this morning. So that either Man, and if Man other creatures alſo (for there is the ſame reaſon) made himſelf, or was from eternity, or was made by another. The firſt is diſproved. The ſecond is falſe. Firſt, becauſe nothing hath been eſteemed more abſurd in reaſon than for to ariſe to an Infinity of Cauſes, one above another. Secondly, then certainly would, the ſame man, yea all men be eternal <hi>conſequently,</hi> as well as <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently;</hi> but the contrary to this, we daily ſee, and therefore may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the contrary to the other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The very nature of Creatures conſtituted of divers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary natures, which are oppoſite and avers to all union, as Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Wet and Dry, Heat and Cold, cannot move of themſelves to that which is contrary to them; but every thing naturally covers to be of it ſelf, and in it ſelf; Fire making towards Fire, and Water to Water, and Earth to Earth; ſo that there muſt be a ſuperiour power, as well to bring
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55232:22"/>
them, and joyn them together in one, as to contain, and continue them there. Which muſt be the firſt Cauſe, and that firſt Cauſe is God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That common ground of all Societies, humane Juſtice, which is an immoveable and indelible principle in the mind of Man, approved of by all, doth evince this. For Juſtice ſuppoſes and infers a Deity. For all Juſtice doth ſuppoſe a Rule, according to which it is ſaid to be juſt, and a Law: to contradict and oppoſe which, is to be unjuſt and injurious. For otherwiſe, it would be at the pleaſure and arbitrement of every man, to make a Rule to himſelf, and for another; according to which all that pleaſed ſhould be reputed juſt: But this would be one of the moſt abſurd, ridiculous, and unjuſt things in the world. Therefore muſt there of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be a common Rule of Right and Juſt: which can proceed from none but the Author of all Beings, and humane Society it ſelf: without which,<note place="margin">Meo judici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the Civil Sanction of Laws to the contrary, doth not make the foreſaid impieties, ſins; neither are they ſimply evil, becauſe they are forbidden thereby: But they are forbidden by Man, and fenced by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, becauſe they are evil: and evil they were abſolutely, becauſe God had ſo decreed them. And as the Laws of all Soveraigns receive their Original vigour from God, ſo were it not that Gods Law fortified, confirmed, and ſecured Kings, they, and their Laws both would be no better then trifles, impertinencies, and impoſtures; which every wiſe man might ſhake off, and confound, when ever it lay in his power. For where obedience and ſubjection is due, it is for ſome reaſon, which reaſon is form'd into a Law. But no man can make a Law whereby he, of no King, ſhould become a King: for before he can make any Law, he muſt be a King or Supream: And therefore this reaſon or Law muſt be Antecedent; and being ſo, muſt have an Author: And who can that be but God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Add hereunto that argument which is commonly taken from the common conſent and agreement of all Men, eſteemed moſt rational; all People, all Nations, concurring hereunto.

                     <p>Sixthly, It is no weak argument of an over-ruling and ſupream Power, which may be taken from the contrary attempts, the vanity and infelicity of them. For it was juſt now granted, that great Wits (as they would be called) may, nay have diſowned this truth. But firſt, conſider we the ſillineſs of their reaſons, and weakneſs of their arguments againſt a Deity, who will yield to nothing but manifeſt, palpable, and invincible demonſtrations for it; and it will be ſufficient to confirm any ſober mind in the faith of it.

How many hath Riot, Luſt, and ſuch like exceſſes converted to this kind of infidelity, more then Sobriety or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie? It is, alas, no wit, no choice, no freedom, or generouſneſs of mind at all: If (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath ſaid) the nobleneſs of the mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in believing the high and noble things) but a contracted ſtupidity, or ſordid ſervility, and unavoidable neceſſity to enjoy themſelves in their low and baſe courſes, which conſtrain them to theſe perſwaſions unnatural to them. But I deny not but ſome of the Learned, and for ought we know, grave Philoſophers, have inclined to Atheiſin, as have many Great, Rich, and Powerful. But firſt, however ſome Princes have been dogmatical within themſelves, and Practical Atheiſts in their unjuſt dealings towards others, yet never dared they to commend or incourage ſuch principles in their Subjects, nor diſcover profeſſedly ſuch to their Neighbours by reaſon of the viſible and monſtrous miſchiefs preſently and naturally ruſhing out of them, to the ruin of themſelves and others. And can that be a truth which is ſo pernicious to the Authors, and promoters of it, all over the World? Again, Can there be any thing more required to prove a thing to be irrational, and abſurd, then that it ſhould never by all countenance and advantages given to it by Power, and Learning, be able to proſper into any one Society upon earth? That it ſhould never prevail ſo far as to be generally and publickly owned in any one Land or Nation? But, like a flaſh of wild-fire, make a noiſe, and a ſhow, and preſently come to nothing. Never could Atheiſts yet, from the Creation to this preſent, unite into a Body, or become a Commonwealth; but againſt all endeavours and devices, when Religion has for a time been diſcountenanced and cruſhed by impious Agents, it hath recovered it ſelf again in deſpite of its adverſaries. Which ſhews that it is implanted in Man, as a natural principle, which may be oppreſſed, but never extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>For whereas <hi>Socinus</hi> and his crew of late, would prove that Religion is not natural to Man, from ſome remote Indians, who, he ſays, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg no God. It is hard for any to make that good: But were it ſo: It doth not overthrow our opinion here, which teaches chiefly ſuch a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralneſs, as upon preſentation of the thing to the mind of man, outwardly; doth meet with ſuch compliance inwardly, as may well be called <hi>Natural.</hi> And beſides, a principal doubt was, whether infinite People directly and poſitively aſſerting, and believing a Deity, any one can be found which dogmatically oppoſe the ſame? None of <hi>Socinus</hi> his inſtances reach to this. And it is not ſo improbable but inhumanity it ſelf may have prevailed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome people ſo far as to have buried all Civility in them. And what wonder is it, or what weakning to our Cauſe in hand, that they, who have ceaſed to be men, ſhould have layd aſide Religion? I do not think Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or the belief of a God more inſeparable from Man, then common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: and yet I may hold it natural too.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOthing is ſo intimate and neceſſary to the very Being of a thing, as the Unity of it; as ſay Philoſophers. Of the Unity of the Deity, therefore as neceſſary to Faith, we ſhall here briefly ſpeak. Where firſt it is to be noted, to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Faith holding there can be but one God, that though many great Wits have attempted boldly to deny a God; yet none of them, who have granted a Deity, have ever ſo much as denyed the reaſonableneſs of that Opinion, which aſſerts the Unity of ſuch a Deity: All generally looking on it as an Excellency to the Divine Nature, to be but One: However it is written of ſome ancient Hereticks, what is ſcarce to be found amongſt the wiſer ſort of ancient Natural Philoſophers, that there was a God of Evil, as well as of Good; conceiving indeed ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that the moſt Perfect abſolute good, cannot produce directly what is evil; but erring herein, that they either thought that to be evil which was not ſo in it ſelf; as evil Beaſts, poyſonous Plants, exceſſive Tempeſts, and the like; or ſuppoſing that what was really evil muſt have ſome poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and direct Agent to produce it; which upon due examination will be found contrary to reaſon.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely, though the firſt thing, and moſt obvious to common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions is, that there is a God, abſolutely; yet this being granted and ſuppoſed, it is much more eaſie to convince an adverſary, who ſhall call in queſtion the Unity of God, that he is but one, then that he is, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: So immediately and neceſſarily does it follow from the very ſubject it ſelf.

But if there be more then one God, and theſe diſtinct and ſeparate in nature, or ſpace, then is there in one, what is not in the other; and the one is what the other is not, for elſe they were not divers, or many, but one, which is argued againſt by Doubters: And if the properties or perfections of one be not communicated to the other, but remain peculiar to each, nothing can be more certain and apparent than that all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not united into one Being: and ſo conſequently, that Being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and defective in ſomething, and ſo not abſolutely and ſimply perfect, and ſo not God; whom we ſuppoſe to be moſt perfect, or not at all.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HItherto have we treated of Natural Religion, as it were, that which all men by the light and force of principles put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man by the hand of God, who made him; ſo that ſcarce doth the Infant turn more naturally to the breaſt of the Mother, than doth Man arrived to the years of reaſon and common underſtanding, ſeek to God, by way of recognition, and dependance on him. But this one end, to which all tend ſo unanimouſly, admitteth of many roads leading thereunto: which particularly to enumerate, were both ſuperfluous and tedious; and therefore may well be reduced to theſe four, Heatheniſh, Jewiſh, Mahometan, and Chriſtian, which are ſo many Religions according to which One God is worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>The Heathen, or Gentile (as the Scripture calls him) worſhip a God; and ſurely deſiring (as all men naturally do) not to err, or be deceived, eſpecially in ſuch matters, as are of greateſt importance (as the choice of a Deity is) do likewiſe rudely intend to adore none but the true God. <hi>For</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> well noteth, and teaches us in his Epiſtle to the Romans)<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>the Creature was made ſubject unto vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope.</hi> By which creature he doth certainly mean the Gentile; who according to the phraſe of Holy Writ, ſpeaking according to the received ſenſe and opinion of the highly opinion'd Jews, was reputed no more of then a ſimple creature, and nature: in oppoſition to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> often makes mention of another, and New creature, as <hi>He that is in Chriſt Jeſus is a New creature:</hi> and elſewhere.

                        <hi>vanity, the works of mens hands.</hi> Now the Creature, or Gentiles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly made ſubject to theſe Vanities and falſe worſhips, in reſpect of that general Principle inſerted in Man, whereby he chooſes truth before error, and conſequently the true God before the falſe: however, through ſome particular Blindneſs of their underſtanding, and darknes, <hi>their</hi>

                        <hi>hearts be alienated from the Life of God,</hi> or from the living God, which is the ſame. Which Darkneſs of the heart may well be imputed to that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal defect, or ſin traduced from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his Poſterity. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, even after that general waſte made in the Soul of Man, God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> well tells them, <hi>left not himſelf without a witneſs, in that he</hi>

                        <hi>did good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs. So that the Inviſible things</hi> of him (as ſaith the<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> ſame St. <hi>Paul) from the beginning of the VVorld, are clearly ſeen, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead;</hi> ſo that they are <hi>without excuſe.</hi> And the reaſon hereof goeth before, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">V. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55232:25"/>
ſhewed it unto them.</hi> The inviſible things of God are ſaid to be ſeen clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are ſufficiently expoſed to be ſeen; and therefore if they do not ſee them, it muſt be the affectation of ſome ſenſual error which ſo darkens their mind, that they cannot, or will not.</p>
                     <p>And being thus firſt corrupted, no marvel if their Religion be like unto it, not only falſe but unreaſonable and abominable; as may appear from theſe few, amongſt infinite reaſons. Firſt from the Object of their worſhip generally directed to a multitude of Gods; and patching up a plenitude of power out of the ſhreds of innumerable Demi-gods, or pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods; whereof one ſhould have power and vertue in one thing, and another in another: but this is to deny God in effect, who, if he be not abſolute, is not at all; and indeed, all the arguments before uſed to prove there can be but one God, do prove that to be a falſe and fooliſh Religion which alloweth and worſhippeth more than one: Neither can it ſuffice to excuſe them, to ſay, that the wiſer of the Heathens acknowledged but one God; becauſe it availeth nothing at all but to add to their condemnation, for any perſons to have a right ſenſe and meaning reſerved to themſelves, and to proceed directly contrary to ſuch found judgment, in their practice and worſhip it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the moſt abſurd and abominable manner of worſhipping their pretended Deities, is ſufficient conviction of the Religion it ſelf. For whereas, modeſty, ſobriety, temperance, chaſtity, truth, juſtice, and the like moral vertues, were ſuch as the Light of Nature did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all men, and all conſented to be excellent and laudable: All theſe were contemned by the admirers of theſe Gods, yea the very Religion it ſelf tempted and incited many to offend againſt all theſe; and that (which is moſt intolerable) from the examples of the pretended gods ſo chuſing to be worſhipped; from whence muſt needs follow what St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Gentiles Religion, and gods. <hi>The things which the Gentiles ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, they ſacrifice to Devils and not to God.</hi> They were impure, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20.</note> ſpirits delighting in abſurd and vitious practiſes. And therefore, upon this ſubject, no more need be ſpoken at preſent.</p>
                     <p>The Neat pretender to true worſhip may be the Mahometan, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the True God ſo far as may be diſcerned, yet faileth egregiouſly in the manner of exhibiting the ſame: the very grounds, and end alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe and unreaſonable. For, firſt; that the Author and Coiner of that worſhip was an impoſtor, and made pretences of Sanctity in the midſt of impurities and infirmities he was ſubject unto, is apparent out of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe times and places, where he, by the aſſiſtance of a Fugitive Neſtorian Monk laid the plot and whole deſign of his Religion, and that among a people altogether rude, ignorant, barbarous, eaſie to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and cheated into a credulity of pretended Revelations.</p>
                     <p>Again, the many abſurdities and contradictions of their Law moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred: as miſnaming of perſons, miſtiming of Facts, miſtaking of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the groſs, impoſſible, prophane, blaſphemous opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature, the will, the Actions of God, contrary to common phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and reaſon; Ridiculous and fooliſh imaginations of Angels, utterly falſe opinions of the nature of things, and ſuch like, being duly and ſoberly weighed and examined, do convince the whole Fabrick of that ſuperſtition, of Idleneſs and fooliſh fictions.</p>
                     <p>And not to multiply more arguments here: The way of propagating this Erroneous Faſhion of ſerving God, diſcovereth the Errour of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55232:25"/>
thing it ſelf. For it is a general and moſt rational Principle deſerving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and belief of all, That Religion, being the moſt excellent act of humane Creatures, ought to have the moſt high and noble Faculty of the ſoul for its proper ſeat and fountain, from whence it ſhould proceed; ſuch as is the intellectual faculty of Man. But this ſuperſtition is carried on by the miniſtery of the Senſes, chiefly. And moreover, It ought to have for its end the moſt ſublime and divine of all. But the Mahometan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituteth the low pleaſures of the Senſes, as the ſufficient and proper end of all their ſervice: making the beatitude of Heaven to conſiſt in perpetual Licentiouſneſs, and freſh delights of ſenſes. And therefore no need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on this ſubject, here: What is here ſpoken being for method ſake ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then neceſſity, or a formal confutation of thoſe Errours.</p>

                        <p> Of the Jewiſh Religion. The Pretence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of it mulled. Their ſeveral Erroneous grounds of the Jewiſh Religion, diſcovered.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>DUT the Religion of the Jew requireth more diligent examination, as well becauſe of a notable preſumption from ancient Tradition, and a certain preoccupation of divine truths; and auctority of divine Conſtitution; as becauſe the conſideration thereof is an introduction to Chriſtian Religion, and the diſproof of that, a proof of the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>And if according to Chriſtians own conceſſions, and the eminenteſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. Paul, they were once the people and true Church of God, <hi>To</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2. cap. 9. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> To them <hi>pertained the Adoption, and the glorie, and the Covenant, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes:</hi> Why not alwayes a Church? If once Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Why not alwayes ſo? If once confeſſed to be pure and Faithfull, When did they ceaſe to be ſo? When firſt entred corruptions into their Church? Under what High Prieſt? And who brought ſuch errours firſt in?</p>
                     <p>This is the ſum of what they can ſay either for themſelves, or againſt the Chriſtians; of whoſe Religion (which undoubtedly they do, and will call Hereſie) they can give the time and place, when, and where it ſprang up; and the perſon who firſt founded and advanced the ſame. And if any Church or Society of men in the world can lay claim to the Promiſes of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and infallibility, ſurely the Jewiſh will pretend much more, from the Prerogatives peculiar to them: as do witneſs every where, the Law and the Prophets,</p>
                     <p>To all this a ſufficient anſwer ſhall be comprehended in the proſecution of the contrary Grounds. which here follows, which I reduce to theſe two; whereof One concerns their Errour about their Law, and the Other, about their Meſſias.</p>
                     <p>The firſt general Errour concerning their Law is firſt that they ſuppoſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55232:26"/>
that the word of God given to <hi>Moſes</hi> for their proper uſe, was equally to oblige all Nations: ſaving where certain priviledges were pretended to Jews by birth, which they ſuppoſe no people were worthy or capable of, except the ſtock of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But that all nations could not be included in that Covenant which was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor were all obliged to the Rites and Ceremonies thereof, appears, from the ordinary impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being obſerved by all People. For how could people of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt parts of the earth appear thrice a year at Jeruſalem, as was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Iſraelites by God, who dwelt in the Land of Canaan? How<note place="margin">Levit. 12. 6.</note> could all Nations at any time bring their Sacrifices to the door of the Houſe of the Lord, to be there received and offered by the Prieſts?</p>
                     <p>Another Errour concerning their Law received by <hi>Moſes</hi> is, that they ſay, It was it whereby men ſhould be juſtified. Which is falſe; and that, Firſt, becauſe the moſt ancient, holy and renowned Patriarchs of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Line were not ſo Juſtified: They were not juſtified by the works, rites, or Ceremonies of the Law delivered them by <hi>Moſes;</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath not only taught us, but irrefragably proved againſt them in ſeveral places of his Epiſtles. For the ſumm of his Argument, and force may truly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this form, as it is laid down more largely in his third Chapter to the Galatians, Judaizing, after the embracing of the Goſpel of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Galat. 3.</note> That way whereby <hi>Abraham, Iſaack, Jacob,</hi> and the moſt holy and renowned Patriarchs of the Jewiſh Line were juſtified before God, muſt needs be it which God chiefly intended for the Juſtification of their Poſterity, to whom all the promiſes of God were made, through them: But neither <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> nor <hi>Iſanck,</hi> nor <hi>Jacob</hi> were Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo religious and rigorouſly now inſiſted on. The firſt part of this reaſon will be eaſily granted by the Jews, becauſe they were the principal of the Jewiſh nation, and honoured by God above any that ſucceeded them; and therefore undoubtedly Juſtified by God. But that this juſtification could<note place="margin">V. 17.</note> not be according to, or by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the forecited Chapter apparently proves: where he ſhews that <hi>the Law was four hundred and thirty years after Abraham.</hi> And how could that which then had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be a cauſe of juſtification of <hi>Abraham?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the accounting of Righteous before God, is to be juſtified before God: But <hi>Abraham</hi> was accounted Righteous before God, by Faith, and<note place="margin">Galat. 3. 6. Gen. 16. 6. Gal. 3. v. 7.</note> not by Law: For ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Therefore, <hi>They that are of Faith, they are children of Abraham.</hi> that is: They, who believed and live as did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed, and heirs apparent of all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to him, whereby all nations (not the Jewiſh only) ſhould be bleſſed.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, No man could ever be Juſtified by that law, but may rather be ſaid to be condemned and curſed by it, which he nor no man elſe did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 26.</note> keep: And the law ſaith expreſly, <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>words of this Law to do them:</hi> which <hi>Confirming</hi> is well explained by the Apoſtle by <hi>Continuing.</hi> For who ever by diſobedience breaketh it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to confirm it, or continue in it. Now, ſeeing all fleſh failed more or leſs in the due obſervation thereof, there muſt be proviſion other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made by God, if ſo be he would have any ſaved. It will perhaps be here ſaid, That God in ſuch caſes had appointed Sacrifices for expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reconciliations with him: But againſt this, not ſo much the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority, as the Argument of the ſame Apoſtle makes in his Epiſtle to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55232:26"/>
Hebrews, ſaying. <hi>In thoſe Sacrifices there is a remembrance made of ſins,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>once every year.</hi> That is, notwithſtanding there were daily Sacrifices made according to the Law, every day; and upon ſpecial ſins peculiar Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made by the offendor for an atonement; yet every year, to ſhew the inſufficiencie of the Precedent Ceremonies, mention was made of the ſins of the People, when the High Prieſt entred into the Holieſt of Holie. And the reaſon of this imperfection is given by the Author to the Hebrews, when<note place="margin">V. 4.</note> he argueth, Firſt, from the nature, the Sacrifices themſelves, That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the blood <hi>of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away ſins:</hi> or as one of their own Prophets before him intimateth, ſaying, <hi>Wherewith ſhall I</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>didſt not deſire, mine ears haſt thou opened: Burnt-offerings and ſin-offerings haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, &amp;c.</hi> All which, with many ſuch like places, do declare what eſteem Good and Godly men had of the Legal Sacrifices, that were but in themſelves inſufficient and unacceptable to Almighty God, for either the expiating and ſatisfying for ſins, or the appeaſing of God offended by the ſame: and therefore ſome further remedie, ſome more excellent means of reconciſiation were neceſſary: And this appears from the ends of ſuch Sacrifices inſtituted: which principally were theſe. Firſt, to declare a right that God had in all thoſe Creatures, which he had given man for his uſe, and ſervice. Secondly, to repreſent to man the guilt and puniſhment, unto which he was ſubject, by his ſins; as verily, as that beaſt ſo ſlain and ſacrificed before his eyes. Thirdly, to inſinuate unto him the true means of becoming reconciled unto God offended: which was,</p>
                     <p>A Second general end of the Old Law, which was to prefigure the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, and only true Saviour of the world: who related not only to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed, but to all, to whom the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> related, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 18. Galat. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> And therefore if ſuch an objection be made, <hi>Wherefore ſerveth the Law,</hi> if not to ſuch Ends? Saint Paul anſwereth thus, <hi>It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, to whom the Promiſe was made. Becauſe of Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Firſt, by reaſon that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſuffice not, of it ſelf, to contain man in his dutie, without the additional ſtatute committed to writing by <hi>Moſes,</hi> called ſignally, <hi>The Law.</hi> Secondly, this became to them under it, a rule and direction, until ſuch time as the ſeed, to whom it was promiſed, <hi>ſhould come.</hi> i. e. The fulneſs of the Gentiles, to whom, through <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> both, the Meſſias was promiſed. Whence appeareth the vanitie of the Jews imagination, ſuppoſing that God, by an immutable decree, had affixed the priviledges and benefits of the Goſpel, entirely to the Jews. And this inferrs another argument uſed by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the perfection, and perpetuity of the Jewiſh Law. For nothing was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed peculiarly, but upon the Covenant of Circumciſion. But <hi>Abraham</hi> was not reputed righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by vertue of Circumciſion; but being Righteous, was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; and all the principal Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of the Faithful, were before Circumciſion, as the hiſtorie in Geneſis aſſures us, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans argueth; and concludes againſt the Jews, <hi>They
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55232:27"/>
which are the children of the Fleſh, are not the Children of God:</hi> that is, in that reſpect, or for that cauſe; becauſe they were lineally deſcended from <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh and blood: <hi>but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> i. e. They were the perſons comprehended in the Covenant, and promiſes made to <hi>Abraham:</hi> all which ſufficiently nulls the Jews pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, taken from their Law. We now proceed to the Second general Head againſt them, taken from their <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

                        <p> The Vanity of the Jewiſh Religion, ſhewed from the proofs of the true Meſſias long ſince come, which are many.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BOth Jews and Chriſtians agree, that the Covenant made by God with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> was through the Meſſias. But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them is notwithſtanding very great. The Jews, ſtill expecting the Meſſias to come, and the Chriſtian believing it, as the firſt Article of his Faith, that he is actually come, and hath delivered his Laws, and performed all things prefigured and promiſed by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> If this ſuppoſition of the Chriſtian be not true, then is the whole Bodie of his Faith a meer ſhadow, and falſe. And if the Meſſias be come, then is the Religion of the Jew falſe, and no better then a vain Superſtition. This therefore is diligently and Faithfully to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into: though with this Caution premiſed, That it is a thing to be ſuppoſed no leſs, and taken for granted in the Chriſtian Religion, that Chriſt the Meſſias is come; then it is to be ſuppoſed to Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that there is a God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe</hi> following Circumſtances evince the Meſſias to be come. Firſt the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expiration of the time prefixed by the Holy Scriptures, and the Jewiſh Doctors themſelves, for the coming of Chriſt. The great Maſters of the Jews affirm that the world ſhall continue ſix thouſand years; whereof two thouſand are to go before the Law, and two thouſand ſhould be under the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that in the fifth thouſand year, the Meſſias ſhould<note place="margin">Sixtus Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis Bibl. lib. 2.

Who theſe are, and from whence they collect this, is no place to ſhew here; <hi>Genebrard, Galatinus, Raymundus Martini,</hi> have done it; and many of the Fathers receiving their tradition from them, have ſpoken to that purpoſe: But the Jews themſelves do reckon from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to this day, above five thouſand four hundred years: and yet there is no appearance of a Meſſias for their turn. So that being driven to this<note place="margin">

Let the Spirit of all them be burſt in pieces who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute times:</hi> as <hi>Buxtorfe</hi> relates to us. And if it be ſo, as ſome Jews have<note place="margin">Buxtorf. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagog. cap. 3. Vid.

Why doth he not appear to their deliverance? They are wont to ſay, <hi>It is for their ſins.</hi> In which I agree with them, that indeed it is for their ſins, that they

are never like to ſee that Meſſias, whom they dream of, becauſe they reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<note place="margin">See Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. Serm. 3. Againſt the Jews. Tom. 6. p. 338, 339.</note> him who came to them, as the true Meſſias.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The apt Analogie and correſpondence between the Meſſias re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Chriſtians, and foretold by the ancient Prophets, doth declare him come. For inſtance, that of Geneſis, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhould</hi>

                        <hi>and they ſhall call his name Immanuel:</hi> (however modern Jews endeavour to pervert and corrupt that text.) That of the Pſalmiſt <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my</hi>

And it being ſo, whom have they to ſhow (now the time is paſt) that many ſtand in competition with Chriſt, our true Meſſias?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſeveral Events prove the Meſſias already come. In Geneſis it is<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10. Numb. 24. 17. Eſa. 9. 6. Eſa. 4. 2. John 5. 43. <gap reason="foreign">

Now theſe can belong to none but him, whom we acknowledge for the Meſſias, Chriſt Jeſus: though diverſe Impoſtors, and falſe Chriſts have pretended to ſuch Prophecies, to the deluſion and confuſion of that unhappy and blind Nation: as Chriſt truly foretold. And however great varietie may be found amongſt Learned Chriſtians concerning the preciſe times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid Predictions had their verification, yet all unanimouſly agree that they are fulfilled; the Jew in vain diſſenting.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Deſtructions and Diſſipations of that Nation and Church prove the truth of the Meſſias come. For now ſo great obſcurity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion are found in their beſt Records, and eſpecially, their Genealogies, upon which depend their aſſurance of their Meſſias, that not knowing now, them of the Tribe of Judah, from them of any other Tribe; and much leſs the Line of David, from others: They are not able to diſtinguiſh a vain pretender, from a real heir of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo muſt needs ſuſpect all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to be the Meſſias.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, by vertue of the Ancient Phophecies and promiſes made unto the Jews, by their Predeceſſors, their form of worſhip was to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Meſſias at leaſt: but nothing is more plain than that this is actually diſſolved; and that in the moſt material parts of it. Their holy City Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, their more Holy Temple in it, and their moſt Holy Altar in that, are all ruined and buried in oblivion: and a Mock City built in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that, by <hi>Alius Adrian</hi> and from him called <hi>Aelia</hi> properly.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The unparralell'd Judgments of God continually purſuing that Nation, until the accompliſhment of all things foretold by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, concerning deſtruction to come upon them, to the utmoſt, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their Expectations, and confirm our Faith in Chriſt, as the true Meſſias. For Firſt, about the time of Chriſts Coming into the world, the Scepter

of all Political and Eccleſiaſtical Power was utterly taken from them. Herod<note place="margin">Scaliger. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. in Chron.

All which ſome find in the Miſterie of Chriſts age, when he was put to death. For it is obſerved that there were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Jubilees from the time that the Iſraelites firſt entred into the Land of Promiſe until the Coming of Chriſt to preach and publiſh the Goſpel: at which time the Scriptures tell us, that he was about thirty years of age: after which time, there were never any more kept by that People. And that John the Baptiſt, (who was the Voice in the wilderneſs preparing the way for Chriſt) was that Trumpet, which was to ſound at the Publication of the Evangelical Jubilee; and ceſſation of the Legal; and abolition of the whole Fabrick of that Church. For (to proceed in the hiſtorie of their miſeries and ruine) about the Fourtieth year after the birth of Chriſt, and ſcarce ſeven years after his death and Paſſion, (whereby they had brought the curſe of innocent blood upon themſelves, and children) a very ſore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamnitie ſeiſed all that people at once; by the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Statue to be erected amongſt them, as a God: which cauſed a great ſlaughter of them at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and coufuſion in Judaea.

About the ſame time in Babylon and Seleucia periſhed about 50000, under the Grand Mutinier <hi>Annelus.</hi> About the year of Chriſt 68, <hi>Florus</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of Syria cruſhed the Jews two years together, until rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romans they were ſet upon by <hi>Ceſtius</hi> the Roman General; who ſlew great numbers of them; waſted their Country, took their ſtrong holds of Defence, held againſt the Romans and raſed them; came to Jeruſalem it ſelfe, and might have taken that alſo, but that God had reſerved them to greater miſchiefs, and vengeance; the Roman army being called off upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions. In the thirteenth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> the year after, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> under the Emperour was recalled out of Achaia to invade and reduce the Jews, to more abſolute obedience and ſubjection, who coming into Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee deſtroyed the Country, and put to death no fewer then 100000 perſons, and led captive with him to the number of fourty thouſand: in the year 72, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> himſelf being Emperour, ſent his ſon <hi>Titus</hi> into Jewrie to finiſh the conqueſts of thoſe mutinous and obſtinate Countries, and after devaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the ſame, coming to the ſiege of Hieruſalem it ſelf; ſo many and unparallel'd were the miſeries ſuffered by them that no age or hiſtory could equal them till at laſt taking the City, firing the Temple againſt his will and ſtrong endeavour, by the tacit and irreſiſtible decree of God, there were numbred of thoſe that periſhed in the Citty no fewer then 1100000; and about fourtie thouſand Captives: with the ſale of which all perſons were glutted, refuſing them at the loweſt and baſeſt rates: the prophecie of old being at this time eſpecially verified, <hi>Ye ſhall be ſold to your enemies for bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

years to attempt any miſchiefs, but about the year 116 under <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, Gods Juſtice began to awake againſt them farther. For in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Roman Empire, as it were by conſent, at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling, they ſlue of Greeks and Romans above two hundred thouſand, and as many in the Iſland of Cyprus alone; but <hi>Trajan</hi> ſending the Roman For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt them, deſtroyed innumerable thouſands of them. In the year 130. mutinying again under <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, being ſeduced by a falſe Prophet, and Chriſt, <hi>Barchocab,</hi> they were deſtroyed with great ſlaughter. And five years after mutinying again, <hi>Julius Severus</hi> was called out of Britain, and going againſt them, deſtroyed fifty thouſand of them, with fifty ſtrong holds, nine hundred principal Towns, raſing eighty to the ground, leaving the Land in a manner deſolate. And the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing finiſhed the work by deſtroying five hundred and eighty thouſand Jews, beſides an infinite multitude which periſhed by Exile ansd Famine: all the Jews being forbidden to remain in any part of Judea, or ſo much as to look back upon it: Jeruſalem is laid quite waſte, and another City built not far from it, named (as is ſaid) <hi>Aelia,</hi> from <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> the Emperour. And to purſue theſe miſerable obſtinate wretches no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince that time (which is as great an Inſtance as any hath been, or can be given of Divine wrath againſt them) though they be in numbers great, and in riches too, and induſtrious, and zealous for their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have been both ſo infatuated and blaſted in all their counſels, and deſigns, that they could never make a Society amongſt themſelves, ſo far as in any part of the World to be governed within themſelves, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Religion, but by reſtraint, and at the will and pleaſure of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now to conclude; That that ſhould be the true Religion which for theſe ſixteen hundred years could no where be truly practiſed, or exerciſed according to the pretended obligations of their Law, the ground and form of the ſame, is incredible, and next to impoſſible. Or that the true Meſſias ſhould not be actually come, or Chriſt ſhould not be he, whoſe predictions and Juſtice have been ſo manifeſtly verified upon his implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemies, and withal, hath ſo far raiſed and exalted, and aſſerted, and propagated, and defended the believers in him, is moſt unreaſonable to doubt of, after ſuch convictions and evidences.</p>
                     <p>But laſt of all, Let any indifferent judge compare the Doctrine and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Jewiſh Superſtition, with the received Rule and ground of it, the Old Teſtament, and he ſhall eaſily diſcern, how they have by their many Talmudical inventions, their bold and ridiculous Comments upon the Scripture, held in no leſs, if not much greater veneration than the Scripture it ſelf, their infinite abſurd and directly falſe Traditions (impoſed upon all of their way) as Oracles; turned their Faith into Fables, and their Facts to have no agreement with the Letter of their Law; but newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented moſt of them, except Circumciſion: (which we have ſhewed they have not as Jews) and he will undoubtedly conclude againſt their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Religion, and Innovated Superſtitions.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> The Chriſtian Religion deſcribed. The General Ground thereof. The Revealed Will of God. The Neceſſity of Gods Revealing himſelf.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFTER the conſideration of Religion in General, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs thereof, with the Excluſion of the principal falſe pretenders of worſhipping the true God; it follows to treat of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Reaſonableneſs, and ſeveral incomparable Prerogatives thereunto proper. And firſt, it is to be known, what we mean by Chriſtian Religion, and what it is?</p>
                     <p>Chriſtian Religion is the worſhip of the only true God in the unity of nature and trinity of perſons, through one Mediatour between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus; according to his Will and Laws revealed in his holy Word, commonly called the Scriptures. This deſcription whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artificial enough I will not contend, but full enough I ſuppoſe it is, to declare as well, What it is in it ſelf, as Wherein it is diſtinct from others. And therefore omitting to treat of the more curious and formal part thereof, we ſhall here ſhew briefly What great advantages it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other, to the obliging us to a more faithful and devout obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; and that this only, and no other can truly pleaſe God, and lead us to him, and crown us hereafter with eternal bliſs and glory.</p>
                     <p>And it having been proved that by the conſent of all Nations there is a God; and it following more ſtrongly upon that ground ſuppoſed, that ſuch a Supream and Infinite being is to be worſhiped, and that this worſhip is that which we call Religion; and that of the Religions pretending to be divine, the others have been found vain and deficient, the Right of being received, as the only proper worſhip of God, muſt of neceſſity devolve upon the Chriſtian Religion, as that which is leaſt obnoxious to the ſame, or like exceptions; and hath many more ſober and rational inducements to perſwade the ſame to any equal judgment. Which argument might well be drawn from the very Body of this Religion, and the ſeveral parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it conſiſteth, together with manifold Pregnant Circumſtances attending the ſame. But becauſe this would ask a far longer time, and more tedious labour both to Writer and Reader then can conſiſt with this intended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium, it may abundantly ſuffice to give ſuch probable and credible proofs of the Scriptures, That they are the revealed will of God as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do believe, without queſtion. For the ſumm and ſubſtance of all Chriſtian religion, ſo far as it is truly ſo called and profeſſed, being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Holy Scriptures, and there expreſly contained, if it be evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that they are of divine Original, it will follow, That what they deliver is ſo likewiſe; and conſequently, the Religion built upon them.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it is one Principle which Chriſtian Religion is built upon, in common with all Religions, that ſomewhat muſt ſo be believed that no natural reaſon or Mathematical can invincibly demonſtrate. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is, becauſe the ground of all ſuch demonſtations is ſetled upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55232:29"/>
the order of Nature between Cauſe and Effect; in point of right rather than matter of fact. But that the Scriptures are ſo the word of God, as to be revealed by his Holy Spirit to certain ſelect Perſons to that end, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter of fact: and that not proceeding from ſuch a neceſſary and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Agent, as that according to the courſe of Cauſes and Effects it could be no otherwiſe; but from a free Agent which certainly might have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſuch acts of Revealing his Will. And the ſame Reaſon holds againſt all proper Demonſtration from Effect. For as it cannot be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that ſuch a Cauſe muſt neceſſarily have ſuch an Effect, it cannot be infallibly proved that ſuch an Effect muſt have ſuch a Cauſe. For unleſs it could be proved that fire muſt neceſſarily burn, it could not be proved that what we ſee burnt muſt neceſſarily proceed from fire. For before this can be don, it muſt be ſhewed that nothing in the world has the ſame virtue, but fire: and this ſuppoſes that we have a perfect and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of every thing, and the nature of it, in the world. Take we an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance yet nearer to our preſent ſubject. It is a common Maxime amongſt the Schoolmen, That no Creature can work a Miracle of it ſelf, but it muſt have the Supernatural power of God, either immediately or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: and, That whatſoever Effects are wrought by any Spirit inferiour to God, deſerve not the name of a Miracle. And yet it is confeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that diverſe ſuch works which appear to us as extraordinary, and above nature, are not of God, but ſome (perhaps evil) Creature. Muſt it not then firſt be known, what thoſe extraordinary acts are, and how they are wrought, before it can be concluded that they are of God? And how can this infallibly be diſcern'd but by another miracle, and this by a third, a third by an infinity, of which there can be no knowledg? So that in truth the received doctrine of the Schools being thorowly examined, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will appear the more reaſonable of the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we muſt rather firſt of all acknowledg a Divine Power precedent and effecting this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtupendious work, before we may call it a Miracle; than firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this to be a Miracle; and then, and thence infer a Divine Power. So that it ſeems very difficult and dubious to make ſcientifical concluſions of any thing divine: And that after all, there may be ſufficient preſumptions to render a thing credible without lightneſs and raſhneſs, yet the Arguments perſwading ſhall not be ſo preſſing and cogent, but due place ſhould remain for a Faith, or aſſent, which may not be properly humane and natural, (which it muſt needs be, if it proceeded ſimply from ſenſe or reaſon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) but divine; and an admirable temperament be found in that we call The true Chriſtian Faith; wherein the Grace of God inwardly moving and inclining the Will to embrace that, to which it might notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all reaſons to the contrary, not altogether unreaſonably have diſſented; and yet with reaſon doth aſſent: the Grace of <hi>God pulling down</hi>

Power, That your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God.</hi> Signifying unto us, that the power of God is no more than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to concur with humane reaſon to the heightning it to ſuch great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: though the Grace of God be all ſufficient of it ſelf to produce ſuch effects; without, yea contrary to ſuch reaſons as humane Philoſophy or Eloquence can miniſter to a man. And this I have held not unneceſſary to be premiſed to this great difficulty of aſſerting and evidencing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the word of God, as well ingenuouſly to profeſs, there appear no ſuch convincing reaſons to prove the ſame, as ſome make ſhew of, and promiſe; as to diſcover the error of ſuch who would have Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to ſtand upon humane Faith. For if Chriſtian Faith be built upon the Scripture, (as is moſt undeniable) and the aſſurance we have that the Scriptures are the word of God, can be abſolutely wrought by outward reaſons, (which cannot be drawn from the Scriptures, being ſuppoſed, at preſent, under queſtion) certainly all our Faith muſt hang upon the veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and certainty of ſuch Reaſons. Therefore muſt this middle way be choſen to acknowledg ſuch prerogatives, even of outward reaſon, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſpoſing mens hearts, that no other Religion or writing can lay any tolerable claim to; and yet ſuch as ſhall ſtand in need of a divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to perfect the ſame, to the nature of a truly divine and Chriſtian aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Faith. Now the foreſaid preparatory and juſtly inclining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may be theſe following, peculiar to the Scriptures. The firſt thing then which muſt be ſuppoſed in this caſe, is, that which all Religions, and even common Reaſon require, that it is the will of God that ſome of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould be ſaved, that is, become bleſſed and happy after this Life is ended, in heaven: But this cannot be ſuppoſed without due obedience and worſhip given unto that great and bountiful Creatour and Saviour: and this Obedience or worſhip cannot be given unto God, in a manner acceptable to him, unleſs this manner be firſt of all known unto man: and this cannot<note place="margin">

And this teaching of him muſt either beby inward, or outward Revelation; Inward Revelation is the natural endowment of the underſtanding given by God unto Man, enabling him to judge of things: and this all People equally ſhare in, (not that there is a neceſſary equality, or ſo much as diſpoſition to knowledg in all men, but that no order of People are denied this benefit; which ſome perſons ſtir up and improve to a more high and excellent degree of knowledg) yet not ſo, but we ſee many perſons, and almoſt people ſo degenerate as not to perceive thoſe things which conduce neceſſarily to the ends of common humanity and civility. Therefore God at firſt in creating of man, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely inſtituted him leaſt the greateſt part of his own workmanſhip, and that by his own intention, ſhould miſcarrie in the due ends of being; or the defects of him originally redound on himſelf. To determine this more accurately, is the office of ſome other place: only this may ſuffice here to note, that man apparently being defective in this ſo neceſſary a point, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in need of ſome ſupply to perfect him in it; divine inward Revelation failing him generally, even in matters of an inferiour nature to devine worſhip. Wherefore, that his will be cleared and revealed outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which inwardly is obſcured and corrupted, is neceſſary to the foreſaid ends: And therefore that the Word of God, which is received by Chriſtians as proceeding from him, and a Declaration of his Will to mankind, is to be made appear ſo far, as it may be credible to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and imprejudicate mind: and ſerve the ends for which it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT coming to the ſame end, to prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and the Religion built upon them to be of God; we ſhall here endeavour to give farther evidence of both together, in this order.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If the Scriptures and Chriſtian Religion have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and aſſerted by God himſelf, it is plain that they proceed originally from God. For as the Scripture telleth us (not without the aſſent of rational men) <hi>Whatſoever plant God hath not planted, ſhall be rooted out.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 13.</note> But God hath ſpecially and wonderfully owned and maintained the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures, therefore by his appointment, were they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For it is a Rule in Natural Philoſophy, which holds no leſs true in Supernatural; <hi>We are nouriſhed and conſerved by thoſe things of which we conſiſt.</hi> Neither is it probable, that God ſhould give any direct counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to that as Divine, which is forged and counterfeit. But we ſee that whereas many eminent and Learned mens Works highly approved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, have periſhed, the Holy Scriptures have been preſerved entire.</p>
                     <p>And this atteſtation of God to them hath been more apparent in the concomitant Acts and Miracles wrought by Chriſt, the immediate Author of them, and his Apoſtles and Servants under him. Chriſt ſaith expreſly, My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me. This he thus proves elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,<note place="margin">Joh. 7. 16. Joh. 10. 25. Joh. 14. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>The works that I do in my Fathers name, they bear witneſs of me.</hi> And again. <hi>Believe me for the very works ſake.</hi> And again. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father believe me not.</hi> From all which fair dealing, it appears that Chriſt<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 37.</note> intended not to impoſe a groundleſs, and reaſonleſs Faith upon the world, but to commend ſuch an one as had ſuch competent demonſtrations, as that ſubject was capable of, or the like Moral things. Now, that ſuch miracles were wrought by Chriſt, and that not by ſleight of hand, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cunning Impoſtours, the Effects themſelves in himſelf, and which is much more, his Followers and Servants in his name, is matter of Credit as much as any thing delivered unto us in humane Hiſtories. Beſides, Chriſts Apoſtles profeſſed they delivered nothing but from God and Chriſt to us: and this they proſecuted with many and great difficulties, dangers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and generally with the loſs of their very bloud, cheerfully poured out, and their lives prodigally ſpent in that teſtimonie, that no men of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or common ſenſe would have gone through ſo much dry ſervice, but upon a divine impulſe and aſſurance of the truth they delivered an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55232:31"/>
of an everlaſting reward for it.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore both Jews and Gentiles enter their Caveat, and affirm, That what Chriſt did, was by indirect means of Evil Spirits: Some Jews ſpecially traducing him with abuſing the Sacred name of God privily born about him to that purpoſe. The Heathens have compared to him <hi>Apollonius, Tyanaeus;</hi> and <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> withſtanding <hi>Moſes</hi> before <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all notorious Magicians. But theſe have received anſwer from moſt of<note place="margin">Arnob. cont. Gentes. Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 1. Euſeb. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt.

                        </note> the ancient and Learned Fathers, who have met with this Exception and to this purpoſe anſwered. Firſt, that it is not true, that they ever wrought ſuch miracles as did Chriſt, and his Servants. Secondly, the wonders they wrought were not done with ſuch ſimplicity and perſpicuity as the other were. Chriſt and his Apoſtles only by the word of their mouths comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the winds and ſeas, and cured the ſick, opened the eyes of the blind, gave ſtraitneſs and ſtrength to the Lame and Creepled; whereas Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are conſtrained to uſe many horrible and ridiculous Rites to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Evil Spirits to act for them. Thirdly, The end of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Miracles mutually juſtifie one another, as to the divineneſs of them. For, moſt or all Magical wonders were wrought to ends agreeable to ſuch Evil Spirits as ſet them on work, <hi>viz.</hi> For Couſenage, for Luſt, for wantonneſs, for malice, for revenge, and ſuch like unreaſonable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But the ends both of the Chriſtian doctrine and Miracles, were no other then Temperance, Continence, Patience, Meekneſs, Charity, and the compleat exerciſe of all ſuch Virtues as nature it ſelf approved and magnified: And declared openly to be done againſt vain-glory, and Licentiouſneſs, and in oppoſition and confuſion of ſuch wicked Spirits as abuſed mankind generally before Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh.

Now theſe things were effected by the Word of God. Which inſinuates,</p>
                     <p>A Third ground of the Divineneſs of the Scripture and Chriſtianity alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> The nature of the Doctrine, whoſe ſimplicity, Majeſty, Puritie, Humility and Sublimity are ſuch as will admit of no Competitors. It is written of <hi>Mahomet</hi> indeed, That having patched up his Alcoran, he openly boaſted and brag'd what he had, done and challenged thoſe pitiful, ignorant, and ſtupid people, to ſhew any man that could compoſe ſuch another piece. But it is certain that himſelf was ſo altogether illiterate and ignorant, and ſo continued, that he could neither write nor read, but cauſed it to be ſet together by better Wits but no better hearts then his: And the very vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory diſcovered ſufficiently the impoſture. But ſuch was the doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, that, ſo far as any thing can prove it ſelf from its native truth and Excellencie, this did manifeſt it ſelf to the world, and captivated more with its plain dealing than ever any of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Philoſophers works, or the Eloquence of humane Orators. Which yet further appears from,</p>
                     <p>A Fourth head, <hi>viz.</hi> The incapacity and infirmitie of the Chiefeſt Agents under God, in inditing and framing the ſame, which amazed the Elders of the Jews themſelves hearing <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> deliver ſuch wonderful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Acts. 4. 13.</note> accompanied with ſuch marvellous works, until they reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

in the reaſon of it, conſidering that they had been with Jeſus: who had taught and enabled them, being but ſimple unlearned and ignorant men of themſelves, ſo to ſpeak and act. And the like may be ſaid of the reſt of the Apoſtles: who likewiſe having been with Jeſus, and afterward more amply furniſhed with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecoſt, ſpake the wonderful works of God, to the Admiration of all their Auditors.

                     <p>And Fifthly, could it be aſcribed to any thing but a Divine power, That ſo many wiſe, ſo many learned, ſo many noble, ſo many rich, ſo many young and old Virgins, tender and delicate, ſhould ſo humbly and devoutly embrace, ſo ſtoutly and hardily maintain with the loſs of their lives, and relations, and fortunes, ſuch a doctrine as brought them no Credit, no profit, no pleaſure, but rigours and Severities, and ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, but by Divine inſpirations?

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the ſeveral Senſes and Meanings according to which the Scriptures may be underſtood.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT being found what is the Letter of the Word of God: It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to know, what is the true ſenſe of it: For this is only in truth, the Word, and not the Letters, Syllables, or Grammatical words. To know this, we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh a Senſe Hiſtorical and Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtorical Senſe is the ſame as the Literal; ſo called becauſe it is that which is primarily ſignified and intended by ſuch a form of words. And this is twofold. For either theſe words are to be taken in the proper and natural ſignification (as I may call that which is in moſt vulgar uſe) or in their borrowed and mataphorical Senſe. As when I call a thing <hi>hard,</hi> and apply it to Iron, or Stone, I ſpeak properly; and according to the Natural ſenſe: but when I apply <hi>Hardneſs</hi> to the heart, I ſpeak improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Metaphorically, and yet Literally too, intending thereby to ſignifie not any natural, but moral quality in the heart. The <hi>Seven Ears,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Geneſis) <hi>are ſeven years,</hi> and <hi>the Seven fat Kine</hi> are <hi>Seven years.</hi> And ſo Chriſt in the Goſpel, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and infinite others in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are Metaphorical and Literal Senſes both.</p>
                     <p>The Myſtical Senſe is that which is a tranſlation, not ſo much of words from one ſignification to another; as of the entire Senſe to a meaning not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Hiſtorical or Literal Senſe, but built upon it, and occaſion'd by it. And is commonly divided into the Tropological, Allegorical, and Anagogical: which ſome (as Origen) make coordinate with the former, ſaying, <hi>The Scripture is a certain Intelligible world: wherein are four Parts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Origen. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 2. In Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſos.</note> 
                        <hi>as four Elements. The Earth is the Literal Senſe. The waters is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Moral Senſe. The Air is the Natural Senſe, or natural ſcience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in found. And above all, the ſublime ſenſe, which is Fire.</hi> In another place he mentions only, the Hiſtorical, Moral, and Myſtical: And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">Idem. Homil. 5. in Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> the Fathers do acknowledg all theſe, though with ſome variation, not diſtinguiſhing them, as we have; as might be ſhown, were it needful to enlarge here, on that ſubject. The Moral Senſe is that which is drawn from the natural, to ſignifie the manners and conditions of men. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical is a ſenſe under a continuation of tropes, and figures. The Anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, a tranſlation of the meaning of things, ſaid or done on earth, to things proper to heaven. The Oxe being ſuffered to eat, while he trod out the Corn; according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Moral ſenſe, ſignified that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer was worthy of his hire. Mount Sinah and Mount Sion (as the ſame<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 24, 25.</note> Apoſtle ſaith) ſignified the two Cities of God, Earthly and Heavenly, Allegorically. And the Church of God upon Earth, the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in heaven. It is therefore without reaſon and modeſty both, that ſome ſtrickt Modern Divines have ſet themſelves againſt the Antient, in contracting all theſe ſenſes into one, ſo as to allow no more: which is of very ill conſequence to the Faith both of Jew and Chriſtian. For ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all the hopes of the Jews concerning the Meſſias to come: and all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55232:32"/>
the proofs of the Chriſtian taken from the Old Teſtament, That he is come, would come to little or nothing, ſeeing there is manifeſtly a Literal or Hiſtorical ſenſe primarily intended; upon which the Miſtical is built. So that the arguments of the Evangeliſts, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that Chriſt was the true Meſſias, muſt needs be invalid, ſeeing their quotation to that purpoſe had certainly another Literal Senſe. And it is againſt the condition of the whole Law it ſelf; which, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 1.</note> ſaith, was a Shadow of good things to come, and not the very things themſelves.</p>
                     <p>It is here replied commonly; That all theſe are but one Literal<note place="margin">

                     <p>And to that which ſeems a Difficultie. That no Symbolical ſenſe can be argumentative or prove any thing in Divinity; we anſwer, That it cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, unleſs it be known firſt to be the true Miſtical ſenſe of the words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; For neither is the Literal ſenſe it ſelf, until it be known that ſuch was the true intent of the Speaker. But thoſe things which were ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically and Myſtically delivered in the Law, being well known to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as likewiſe to the Learnedeſt of the Jewiſh Doctors by a received current tradition amongſt them, were of force to the ends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by them. But where ſuch a Myſtical ſenſe is not received, nothing can be inferred from thence, which is concluſive.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT availeth a Chriſtian as little to have the Letter of the word of God without the genuine ſenſe, as it doth a man to have the ſhell without the Kernel. For the ſenſe is the word of God, not the Letter.

                        <hi>they, that are unlearned and unſtable, wreſt, as they do all other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction.</hi> Therefore, becauſe it is very neceſſarie to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the difficulties and dangers in miſinterpreting Scripture, before we can throughly apply our ſelves to prevent and avoid them, we will Firſt ſhew briefly, That many things are difficult in Scripture, and the Reaſons why: and after proceed to the moſt probable means rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55232:33"/>And theſe obſtacles in attaining the true ſenſe of Gods word, are either found in our ſelves or in Gods wiſdome and Providence; or laſtly in the Word of God it ſelf. Some indeed piouſly but inconſiderately make all the reaſon of difficulties (not denied by them altogether) in the Scripture, to be in Man: ſuppoſing they hereby vindicate Gods Providence from that cenſure it might otherwiſe be liable unto, if ſo be that God ſhould deliver ſuch a Law to man which could not well be underſtood, but apt to mislead men into errour. And therefore, ſay they. It is the darkneſs, and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mans underſtanding and will, that make things in Scripture obſcure, and not the condition of the Scriptures themſelves. But this no ways doth attain its end. For when did God deliver his written word unto Mankind? In his ſtate of innocencie and perfection, or imperfection and blindneſs of mind? God certainly knew that man was frail, and apt to miſtake, when he delivered his Law: How then is this an Apologie ſufficient for him, who gave ſuch a Law, as was diſproportionable to his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the time of giving it? But then ſecondly, conſidering that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the thing to be underſtood are <hi>Relatives;</hi> and that it comes to the ſame end, whether the Facultie be unapt to conceive, or the Object unapt to be conceived; ſuch an excuſe is to no purpoſe. But yet withal wo muſt note that man is not to be excuſed from guilt in miſunderſtanding. Firſt, be cauſe he willingly brought this defect upon himſelf by his Original <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Secondly, Becauſe he, through vile and vitious affections doth oftentimes contract a greater darkneſs and diſorder than is natural to him, even in this ſtate of Original ſin. And God, as all other Law-givers, did not proportion the Law given, according to the contingent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of particular mens underſtanding, but according to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Scantling</hi> found generally in Man: So that undoubtedly ſome men are the proper authors of their own ignorance in divine matters, through their affected evil manners: as the Scripture, and the Fathers join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly ſhew.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond General reaſon is from God. 1. Calling man to the knowledge of himſelf, and that by his word; and never intending to alter the courſe of nature, and general ſtate of man in this life, which was, and is, to be fallible (Infallibilitie being the portion of the bleſſed in the life to come;) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t were not impoſſible that God ſhould either by ſo framing his word, or ſo reframing man, have ſecured him from erring about it, but he hath not ſo done: neither doth it appear, how ſuch Exemptions and priviledges could conſiſt with his Providence more general. For,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Providence of God having determined to preſerve humane and divine Societies, as he had conſtituted; this can hardly be underſtood to be more readily and ſafely effected than by mutual obligations, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mutual offices to be done one towards another. And the firſt thing conducing hereunto, is, the Order of Governors and Governed, of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Scholars; of ſuch as teach, and ſuch as are taught in the Word. But if every man were wiſe in the Laws of man, had the power of the Sword juſtly given into his own hands, or the power of the Word in his own breaſt, then would there be no need at all of Rulers or teachers to teach or inſtruct; or reprove and redreſs errours in manners: becauſe, Every man is ſuppoſed to be an independent Prince: and though he ſhould offend againſt nature it ſelf, was not to be puniſhed by one who had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority over him. Hence there fore it is, that God moſt wiſely hath ſuffered an inequalitie of Perſons in all Ages, all Faculties, all Policies, as well
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55232:33"/>
divine as humane, that the more ſtrickt the bond is, the more intire the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and unity might alſo be.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As this diſcrimination ſecures the neceſſary relations between men within themſelves, ſo doth it the dependance between God and Man, which muſt never be forgotten. For, as for the Father to deliver all the writings of his Eſtate to his ſon, and to put him in preſent and full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all his wealth, is the next way to tempt his ſon to forget and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect him and no more to acknowledg any duty to him; in like manner, were it ſo that God, at once, ſhould have put man in ample and abſolute knowledg of his holy writings and will, without reſerving to himſelf the farther manifeſtation of difficulter matters, there would be no addreſs to God, no worſhip, no ſeeking to him for ſatisfaction and information in the Care of his Soul. One main end and office of prayer would be extinct. So we read that God deſigning the Law to the Iſraelites, provided afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, That the ordinary Rulers ſhould judg the people at all time; but the hard cauſes, they ſhould bring to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, caſes too hard for him, to God: As in the Caſe of him that gathered ſticks on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and of <hi>Zelophehads</hi> daughters.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God ſuffers this, to the end he might quicken, and excite our Endeavours and induſtry in the ſearch after his holy will ſo reveiled unto us. For, were it ſo that all things were preſently and readily obvious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, there would be wanting that excellent vertue of labour, to which God hath ordained all men ſince the fall; to perſerve them from greater miſchiefs incident to weak man. And beſides, contempt and ſlighting are<note place="margin">Beſides thoſe Texts of Scripture, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and depth of ſenſe, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery laid up in them, are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; there are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things that are <gap reason="foreign">

There are I ſay, more of them in Scripture then in any writer that I know ſecular or divine. Dr. <hi>Hales</hi> Serm. 1. p. 22.</note> alwaies the conſequent of what is plain and familiar to us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that argument which ſome uſe to prove all things evident in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and others contrariwiſe, that all things are unqueſtionable in the Church, ſo that according to the opinion of the one, a man committing himſelf to the holy Scriptures, and according to the other, ſubmitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Church, in all things, he may promiſe himſelf ſecurity, rather than ſafety, do make more againſt this; It being more certainly the Will of God, (while we war in the Church militant) we ſhould never reſt ſecure from due ſolicitudes, and temptations; but by often contentions with him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſelves from falling from the true Faith, or falling into a falſe Faith.</p>
                     <p>A third General reaſon of the obſcurities in Scripture may be taken from the Scriptures themſelves: which not compared with the general ability of mans reaſon and underſtanding only, but with other writings alſo, are of difficult acceſs: and that will be thought no calumnie, if it be conſidered, Firſt, That the languages in which they were originally written are ſo far periſhed now adayes, that they are familiar to no nation, neither can the many Idioms and proprieties of the phraſe be well underſtood by us. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Hiſtories thereof, and the ſeveral cuſtomes, rites, Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, amongſt the Heathens, as well as Jews and Chriſtians; the habits, geſtures and acts, very eaſily known and readily apprehended by ſuch as lived in thoſe dayes and places, are now hardly to be underſtood. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The difficulty of diſtinguiſhing between Canonical and Uncanonical Writings. Fourthly, The ſubtilty and artifices of Heretiques, in their corrupting, if not the Letter, yet perverting the genuine ſenſe: Yea, the very Orthodox Expoſitors are themſelves ſo various and unconſenting in the true meaning, that they much more diſtract and unſettle, than guide or promote men in the knowledge of Scripture it ſelf; which naked would
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55232:34"/>
be better underſtood and reſolved on, then with them. Fifthly, The ſeeming oppoſition and contradiction in Scripture, are no little impediments to the ſetling of mens minds in the knowledg of them. Sixthly, a Sixth diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will be, The diſtinguiſhing of things Judicial, Ceremonial and Moral, ſo far as to be aſſured, How far it is lawful to uſe, or neceſſary to refuſe, what is preſcribed by Precept, or example in the Old Teſtament.

And all theſe I recite to no other end, than to flacken the precipitancy, and cool the impetuous and preſumptious heat of ſuch, who, the leſs able they are to examine and judge, the more confident they are to conclude out of Scriptures, what they phanſie and like beſt: refuſing the outward and ordinary means of receiving the true ſenſe, upon indeed a certain truth, That Gods Spirit is the beſt interpreter of its own Laws; and God is able to direct them in the ſober uſe of them; but a moſt unſound and unſafe inference from hence, that God doth, or will ſo aſſiſt them, when they neglect thoſe ſober outward means he hath no leſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to that end then the former. Of which means we are in the next place here to treat.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Opinion, That all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough delivered in Scripture, is pious, and reaſonable enough, taken with its due qualifications and limitations; namely, of Perſons, of Times, of Places, and ſuch like. For of things ſuppoſed to be neceſſary, all are not to all men alike neceſſary, no not to the ſame man, at all times. For there are ſome Articles of Faith that are ſufficiently explained and propounded to him, others are not ſo; and therefore in relation to ſuch a perſon, not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be explicitly believed. Again, ſome points of Religion are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be received for their own ſakes, after due propoſal, others are neceſſary to be received for the ſake of others; and ſo imediately only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The Articles in the Creed of the Apoſtles are moſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort, to be, for their own ſakes, believed: But the Articles of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55232:34"/>
Church, and its power, and autority, (which I take not to be mentioned in the Creed as moſt do) are neceſſary for the preſervation of the true Faith it ſelf: For without the uſe and receiving of Diſcipline, there can be no Church properly ſo called (as may hereafter be prooved) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Church there can be no long continuance of Faith. Therefore, from hence it is not difficult to null the pretenſions of ſome ranck Diſputants, who lay it as a Principal foundation, and ſo reaſonable, that it ſcarce needs any thing but clamours and out cries to make it take effect on them that ſhall dare to reject it, That nothing is neceſſarily to be offered to the Faith of any, or to be by him received, which is not expreſſed in holy writ. For in holy writ, it is neceſſary to obſerve and obey ſuch as are ſet over us in the Lord, ſo far as we are not convinced, that they determine or impoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing contrary to the word of God. And for ought doth appear, it is as neceſſarily required that we ſhould depend upon our Guides in the Church for the due meaning of the Scriptures, as upon the ſuggeſtions of Gods Spirit which refuſeth not, but requireth ſuch outward means concurring with its direction. For nothing can be more abſurd or vain than ſimply to depend upon divine intimations of Gods Spirit, becauſe it is all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, of it ſelf, to ſuch purpoſes. For it is not only ſufficient to them, but to all other, as well divine as natural ends; and yet to ſo reſt on it as to neglect or paſs over contemptuouſly other meanes, is rather to provoke God to denie the ordinary aſſiſtance of it. For God doth not act in the world according to his power, but according to his Will and Promiſe made unto us. It is true, that Chriſt hath promiſed in St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Whatſoever ye ask in my name believing, ye ſhall receive;</hi> and<note place="margin">Math. 21. 22.</note> by St. <hi>Luke</hi> more expreſly, <hi>If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>unto your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like promiſes of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Gods bleſſed Spirit, muſt not be ſo abſolutely underſtood, as that all who ſimply crave it, ſhould forthwith certainly be therewith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed; becauſe St. <hi>James</hi> (as other places of Scripture) explains and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains this large promiſe, according to the Oeconomie, or more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tenour of the Goſpel, <hi>i. e. That we ask aright,</hi> and <hi>believing,</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we in prayer do duly obſerve, may be well doubted of us; though we doubt not of the <hi>Theſis</hi> it ſelf, or Rule, That he that asketh aright ſhall receive.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, theſe are ſenſes in which ſuch promiſes are truly verified, and Gods Spirit truly given, and yet not a full importment of all the graces which flow from it. For they, who at firſt were called to the Faith of Chriſt, and baptized, were indued with the holy Spirit, and yet not preſently inſtated in the diſcerning of all the myſteries of Chriſtian Faith, but ſtill depended upon the Prophets and Apoſtles, and interpreters of Gods will, for the attaining of his will even revealed in General. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the known diſtinction, there are ſpiritual Gifts ſignally ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſpiritual Graces. And ſome men may receive the influence of Gods Spirit in the way of Grace, which ſanctifies the will and affections, and not of Gifts, which illuminates the mind and underſtanding; and that not only to the uſe of things abſolutely neceſſary to our Salvation, but to the benefit of others.</p>
                     <p>Add hereunto, That notwithſtanding the Spirit is ſo ſufficient of it ſelf, and God doth grant it to them who ask it of them; We know that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is not granted to any, but in the way which Chriſt ordained the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55232:35"/>
ſame, and that was, that firſt, it ſhould deſcend (as it alſo did) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and primarily upon the Church repreſentative, or Ruling; who were then his Apoſtles and holy Diſciples; and in like manner is it ſtill to be expected ſoberly, through the mediation of ſuch as are by Chriſt ſet to govern the Church, and rule under him, herein ſucceeding the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and not immediately, and by a leap from the head to the loweſt members: which though it may be, yet is ſo rarely, that none can without another extraordinary confirmation, reſt ſatisfied that ſo it is really with him.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for our clearer proceeding, We are herein to diſtinguiſh between the attaining to the true ſenſe of Scripture, and the deciſion or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Controverſies according to the Scripture. And that the moſt important Query is not ſo much, Whether a man hath the Spirit, or not, or whether he hath the trueſt and moſt genuine meaning of the Spirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Scriptures, or not; but how this ſhould be made known and manifeſted ſo far unto others, as that they ſhould rationally and ſoberly reſt ſatisfied in the opinions of the ſaid pretenders to ſuch truths. For, its well and ſmartly ſaid in this doubt, The Queſtion is not, Whether the Spirit in a Man or Church, or the Scripture, (though this laſt way is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improperly expreſſed) be the beſt Judge of the Senſe of Scripture; but where it reſides, to ſuch purpoſes? And what a great ſtir is made to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, while the former is ſo eaſily granted on all ſides, and there is nothing done at all to convince a ſober man or Chriſtian, That ſuch or ſuch perſons are they we ought expect the dictates of Gods Spirit from. For, Judgement, properly ſo called, can never be ſeparated from Autority, or lawful preſiding over others, joyned with power to oblige to ſuch ſentence as ſhall be paſſed: but how this ſhould be competible to ſingle, or many Perſons agreeing in the ſame thing, in their private capacity; yea though enabled with the ſpirit more than ordinary, cannot well be underſtood. So that at moſt, they can be judges of controverſies only for themſelves, and that at their own peril; and can do no more than perſwade, adviſe, and exhort, not oblige others to think as they do: But Judges muſt, and ought to do more, or they had as good do nothing. So that, that which hath found great acceptance and applauſe by too many, doth upon examination prove very inſignificant and impertinent to the reſolution of the difficultie in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That things that are neceſſary are obvious in Scripture, and, Every man is Judge to himſelf: granting; I ſay, This; (which is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally untrue) yet ſcarce any thing is ſaid to the purpoſe; which enquired not ſo much, How a man might perſwade <hi>himſelf,</hi> but how, and with what influence he may proceed to the conviction and reducing of <hi>others;</hi> ſo that the <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Church be not deſtroyed, as it certainly muſt be, where no communion is; and there will infallibly ceaſe all communion where it is meerly arbitrary for Chriſtians to believe and judge and walk and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as they pleaſe. For, this it is for every man to judge for himſelf. Will it be yet farther ſaid, That we ſhould bear with one another, and live peaceably and charitably one with another, and not moleſt each other for his Judgement; If it be, as I know it is; I reply firſt, That this plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, without poſſibility, is not true according to the opinions of them who uſe it. For they certainly hold, That Hereſie and Schiſm are not to be endured or born withal. Chriſt and God muſt not be blaſphemed by unſound opinions, or prophane or ſuperſtitious actions: and this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, yea, contrariety of judging, muſt needs find theſe faults in one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55232:35"/>
another, very often; and conſequently, be of opinion, That they are not to be ſuffered; and Charity muſt not be ſo far miſtaken or abuſed, as to licentiate ſuch enormities.</p>
                     <p>But, What if after all this contention for the Spirit, it be not judge at all, as in truth it is not, in any proper ſenſe? For, the Spirit is only the due qualification of the Perſon, or Perſons, not ſimply to judge (for that deſcends upon them by being ordinarily, and orderly conſtituted over the Church of Chriſt) but to judge aright; and to give faithful and unerring ſentence in matters under debate and queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame may be, in proportion, affirmed of Reaſon termed by ſome, who would ſeem to excell others in reaſon, moſt improperly, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably, Judge of Controverſies; For all judgement, diſquiſition, and expoſitions, are made by Perſons, not by things. Reaſon indeed is the Inſtrument whereby a Perſon is enabled to judge, or find out the truth; unto which unleſs there be a due acceſſion of Autority and Power, ſuch reaſon, though very exquiſite and happy, muſt keep within its own doors, and judge at home for it ſelf, and not for others: nor contrary to more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and autoritative determinations, without the peril of being taxed of Arrogance, and it ſelf juſtly condemned, if not for the Inward errours of the mind, for the outward errors in ill managing truths.</p>
                     <p>If it were ſo, That Reaſon in men were infallible, we ought not to ſtand upon nicities of terms, or improper language. But for men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others the <hi>Seat</hi> and Power of Judicature, becauſe they may err; and to take it to themſelves, as if the ſpirit of Error had no power over them, is at the ſame time a grievous, though pleaſing error, both againſt Reaſon and common juſtice too.</p>
                     <p>And if it be ſaid, That every man is bound by the Law of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indued with reaſon, to uſe that reaſon, and not bruitiſhly to ſuffer himſelf, he knows not or cares not whether, to becarried by others Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not his own: I retort, And every man is obliged by the Law of Nations, which is a more refined principle than that of groſs Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken, to contain himſelf in the order of Community he is placed, and to ſubmit to the reaſon of common Judgement, no leſs than his own. For, undoubtedly, until every man in private and particular, be unerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (which is not to be expected on this ſide heaven) there will diverſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent judgements prevail, and divide one from another; and cauſe ſuch a breach as the ſociety, whether divine or humane, will ſoon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and come to nothing. But granting what was before demanded, That every man muſt act according to his reaſon above the nature of beaſts; this doth not conclude, That therefore he muſt be let alone; and not brought, even by force, to ſubmit to others, againſt ſuch reaſon. Firſt, Becauſe it is not reſolved by any but a mans own deceitful opinion, That it is really reaſon which is ſo preſumed to be. Secondly, Becauſe he that is ſo conſtrained to ſubmit his reaſon, is not thereby denyed either the nature or uſe of his, but ſtill much tranſcendeth the capacity of beaſts: For, He diſcuſſes, he diſcourſes, he judges rationally, after the manner of men; even when the effect of all theſe Acts are contrary to reaſon. And laſtly, In wiſe men, and good humble Chriſtians, there is a ſuperior principal of reaſonableneſs to that of meer direct nature: For, That he that has moſt reaſon on his ſide and (when that it ſelf is controverted) he that according to appearance of Circumſtances, may lay the faireſt claim to that, is to be followed, no rational man can deny. Therefore, ſhould a Mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55232:36"/>
reaſon perſwade him, That he hath found out the truth, and yet at the ſame time aſſure him, That he is no leſs fallible than another man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may poſſibly embrace and hug a falſe conception with as much fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a true; and withal, That private Judgements are not in themſelves ſo ſafe as publique, nor ſingle, as many. What violence were this to his reaſon, nay, how much more rational than the firſt ſimple Act, to comply with the Reaſon of others, whom reaſon alſo requires to liſten to and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; and Scripture much more?</p>
                     <p>From hence we may rightly conclude againſt both extremes in theſe days, who yet agree in this very ill-grounded opinion, That there muſt be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Director or Judge, or we cannot ſubmit to them, in matters of Faith and our Salvation. This is abſolutely untrue, both in humane and divine matters. Who ſees not indeed that it were to be wiſhed for, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things deſired? Who ſees not the great inconvenience for want of ſuch a ſtandard of opinions as this? But can we rationally conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſo it is? Or hath God, or ought he, of his neceſſary goodneſs and wiſdom (as ſome have ventured to affirm) to grant all things, that are infallibly good for man? Is it not ſufficient, that a fair (though not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible) way is opened to attain the truth here, and bliſs hereafter; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one muſt find it? Is it little or no abſurditie, That infinite never come to means of truth, and ſo great, that many who enjoy them, do not receive the benefit by them.</p>
                     <p>Again, Are good manners and virtues no leſs eſſential to Salvation than Faith? and is there no infallible Judge of manners? Is there no infallible Caſuiſt? And muſt there be of points of Faith? How many have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule of holy Life, and yet miſtake either in the ſenſe or applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, ſo far as to periſh in unknown Sins? And yet none have, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that great and common evil, call'd for an infallible Cenſour, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations might ſettle doubtful conſciences in greateſt ſafety, and ſilence all apologies which are wont to be made for our ſins and errors, and ſo bring us nec eſſarily to truth or leave us under ſelf and affected condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>But, The Ground of this miſtake being farther ſearched into, will be found very weak and fallacious. <hi>An infallible Faith</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt have an infallible Judge:</hi> And of theſe ſome aſſume thus. <hi>There is no man infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Therefore no man can be Judge of Faith:</hi> Others aſſume thus. <hi>But there is, and muſt be an infallible Faith; Therefore, there muſt be an infallible Judge.</hi> So that we ſee, both would have infallible Judges; but differ only in their choice of them. For, The former would have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Judge and Rule, which is very honeſt; but very ſimple. The later would have ſome external Judge; which hath much more of reaſon in it: And fails only in the choice of this Judge, or in the deſcription of him. For, There is nothing more unreaſonable than to ordain that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate to be Judge of it ſelf; beſides the great abſurdity of confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Law;</hi> and the <hi>Interpreter</hi> and <hi>Judge.</hi> And, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more fallacious than to confound Cauſes and occaſions together; as the later opinion doth. For, If the Church, or whatever Judge may be ſuppoſed, were the true direct cauſe of our Faith; then indeed it would neceſſarily follow; That our Faith could no wayes be infallible, unleſs the Judge were alſo infallible; the effect not exceeding the cauſe, nor the Concluſion the Premiſes or propoſitions from whence it was deduced: But, Becauſe the Church is only on Occaſion, or a Cauſe without which we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55232:36"/>
ſhould neither believe the Scriptures in general to be the Word of God, nor any ſentence to be duly drawn from the ſame, there is no neceſſity at all of ſuch a conſequence. For, The Infallibility now ſpoken of, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing believed, which is the Word of God, of which the Church, I hope, is no Cauſe, or the Grace of Faith excited and exerciſed by us through the Spirit of Grace in us: the myniſtery of the Church ſerving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: acording to St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying, <hi>We therefore as workers together with</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>him, beſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, as in things natural, He that applies Actives to Paſſives, that is, the Cauſe proper, to the matter about which the Action is, is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or natural cauſe of the Effect, but the occaſion only: yet is ſaid vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly, ſo to be; as when a man applies fire to combuſtible matter, he may (though improperly) be ſaid to burn it, when it is the fire, and not he, that burns it: So the Church or Judge of Scriptures ſenſe applying the ſame to a capable ſubject, the effect is true and infallible Faith, but it is not the effect of the Church, or inſtrument (or mean rather) but of the Holy Spirit, of Grace, which taketh occaſion from thence to produce Faith, and that infallible. For; Were this Infallibility, we now ſpeak of, the Churches then, when ever the Church ſhould ſo propound and urge points of Faith, they muſt needs have an effect in the Soul: For, if they ſay, The Church teaches in an humane way, they ſay ſhe teaches in a falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way: which overthrows all. And from this is cleared that difficulty, which oppoſeth a Judge of Scripture and Faith, becauſe none could be found infallible; For not making the Judge the cauſe of Faith but occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may be neceſſarily required to Faith: God who is the only prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe with his holy word, ſeldom or never concurring without thoſe outward means. And therefore, though I readily enough grant, That the Scriptures are ſo plainly written, that a ſingle ſimple perſon wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting greater helps to attain to the abſtruſer ſence of them, and uſing his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſimple endeavour, may eaſily find ſo much of the Rule of Faith and holy Life, as to be ſaved by them; yet I cannot ſay the ſame of any men who preſuming on Gods power, againſt his promiſe, which includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the uſe of outward meanes, or miſtaking his promiſe for abſolute, when it is conditional, ſhall look no farther than their own wits ſhall lead them.</p>
                     <p>Now, The outward meanes to which God hath annexed his promiſe of Grace may be theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That which we have here handled, a general and ſober ſubmiſſion to the Guides of our youth and our ſpiritual Fathers and Paſtors in Chriſt; which to forſake, is the part of a wanton and fornicating Soul, according to <hi>Solomon.</hi> This, common Reaſon and nature it ſelf ſeem to require of all<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 17.</note> under Autority, by the diſpoſition of Almighty God; That they in the firſt place hearken unto the voice and explication of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are educated, until ſuch time as a greater manifeſtation of truth ſhall withdraw them unwillingly from the ſame. For, ſo long as Senſes are equally probable on both ſides, we are obliged by conſcience to our proper Fathers in Chriſt. For, to do otherwiſe, is to provoke God to deliver ſuch over as light and gadding Huſwifes, to the impure embraces of any ſeducer to Schiſm and Hereſie. But, when ſuch a conviction ſhall be wrought in us, of the errors and unſafety of that communion in which we were educated, That we muſt either forſake that, or Chriſt; then muſt the advice and ſentence of our Saviour prevail with us, in St. <hi>Luke.

But of this, as we have already ſpoken in part, ſo may there offer it ſelf a more proper place, more fully to ſpeak afterward.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond general means to attain the true ſenſe of Scripture is indeed the Spirits aſſiſtance, by which it was at firſt compoſed: There is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none like to that. For, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it.) <hi>What man knoweth the</hi>

                     <p>And notwithſtanding, ſpeaking Philoſophically, it is not repugnant to reaſon, That things delivered from Father to Son, through many ages, ſhould perſevere in their priſtine integrity, and be preſerved incorrupt in the main; yet is it inconſiſtent with the Fallibility of humane nature, to ſecure them in all Points from violation, either without writing, or with. All the world concurring in this: That the Invention of Letters was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gift of God towards Mankind, for the more ſafe and profitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of things paſſed to following times. Such an intollerable Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox<note place="margin">Creſies Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologeſis.</note> is that which modern Wits (their ſcarce tollerable Tenets urging them thereunto) have of late vented, and to their beſt defended; That Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taken in contradiſtinction to Writing, is more ſafe than writing;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55232:38"/>
as if writing had not all the priviledges belonging to oral Tradition, with great advantage: or becauſe written monuments may ſuffer by tract of time, and paſſing ſo many hands, unwritten traditions might paſs ſo many ages and mouths inviolate: When, while we ſee too great variety in the reading, or letter of books, we could be ſo blind as not to behold infinite more of the ſame nature in Traditions: It is as ſeldome found, That a tale ſhould be reported in the very ſame phraſe or words it was at firſt told, as it is that things tranſcribed with any common honeſty, or diligence, ſhould fail conſiderably, ſo much as in the Letter. And if they ſay, in Tradition, forms of words are not ſo much to be ſtood upon, doth it not altogether hold as good when this Tradition is written? How then do not men bluſh to argue ſo boldly, and at the ſame time ſo weakly?</p>
                     <p>There is therefore a twofold Infallibility to be diſtinguiſhed, as well in Relation to unwritten Doctrines, as written; the one conſiſting in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivered; the other in the manner ſo delivering: And truly, as to this later, it cannot be ſaid, without ſome ſtrong Preſumption to the contrary, the written Traditions which are the Scriptures, have been ſo preciſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God (granting ſome ſuch minuter defections from the Original Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies) hath been ſingular in preſerving them in that degree of perfection and entireneſs, we now enjoy them: So that infinite is the diſparity in this caſe between them and unwritten Traditions, which none have been ſo audacious poſitively to affirm (though indeed their large and looſe reaſons ſeem to tend that way) that any one unwritten doctrine hath been conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto us in the ſame form of words it was at firſt delivered to the Church.</p>
                     <p>And the like, though not ſo great advantage is to be acknowledged on the Scriptures part, compared with the pretended unwritten word of God, in reference to the matter: and that in theſe three reſpects. 1. The Evidence. 2. The Importance; and 3. The Influence that the doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have, and ought to have over all Traditions.</p>
                     <p>And for the firſt; It is impoſſible (taking traditions as they are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from Scripture) that the like grounds of Faith ſhould be offered to us, as we have above ſhown are to be found, proving the Scriptures to be the word of God. For are all, or ſome only Gods word? All cannot be, becauſe Traditions in ſeveral Places of the world have been diverſe, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Becauſe ſome are acknowledged to have been the Conſtitutions of Men, or the Church, ſince the Apoſtolical Age. Becauſe many are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been quite loſt. Becauſe many have been confeſſed to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, of them which remain. Now if the Church hath failed in the due Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of ſuch treaſures committed to her, How can any man be aſſured ſufficiently of the integrity of the remainer? How can the Church be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Infallible Witneſs of traditions? And who can but admire the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſuch Patrons of the Churches fidelity, or rather felicity (for I would not, nor need I call in queſtion its good will and Honeſty) in her Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Preſerving the Monuments of our Religion untouch'd by errors, who by reaſons would demonſtrate that that cannot be, which we ſee done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes? For at other times the ſame Party, if not the ſame perſons, ſtick not to profeſs, that divers Antienter Traditions are periſhed, and more modern have ſucceeded them. They ſay, that ſome Traditions are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

as ſenſe can make them: The Tradition that there were ſuch famous Cities as Nineve and Babylon, and are ſuch as Conſtantinople and Rome, requires the ſame Faith, as the beholding them with our Eyes. But firſt, It ſhould have been ſaid in the argument, They are as evident as thoſe things we are informed of by our ſenſes: but this is far from truth: All the teſtimonies of Paſt and preſent perſons affirming that to be ſo which I have no ſenſe of immediately, being abundantly ſufficient to beget a belief, but not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in evidence the teſtimonie of any mans well-diſpoſed ſenſes. For does not this ſo general teſtimonie it ſelf, depend upon a mans ſenſes receiving the ſame? Or can any man be ſo well aſſured, upon the Credit of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatever, that the Apoſtles delivered ſuch things to be believed and obſerved by the Church, as if he himſelf immediately received the ſame from them?</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that the caſe of Eccleſiaſtical Tradition is far different from humane, in that the Church is divinely aſſiſted to ſuch ends, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this at preſent, ſtill we are no leſs intregued then before. For, as is ſaid, The <hi>truth</hi> of a thing, and the <hi>Evidence</hi> whereby it appears to be true, are very much different: And here it will be no leſs difficult to make ſuch a ſuppoſed Aſſiſtance appear, then the tradition it ſelf, which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to the World, upon ſuch pretences. And therefore, they who have ſifted this matter more narrowly, and ſtated it moſt rationally, have thought it beſt to forſake ſuch <hi>topicks,</hi> at preſent, as Extraordinarie Aſſiſtances: and<note place="margin">Hen. Holdeni Analyſis Fid.</note> tell us plainly, that what the Church doth in this caſe, ſhe doth it not as divinely directed, but as ſo many Men delivering their teſtimonie, which is true, but then, what becomes of Infallibility; all men ſingly and conjointly, as men, being fallible? Well therefore they proved to tell us, That to a jugde of Controverſies, Credible Teſtimonie, or moral infallibilitie may ſuffice; and to this I agree in the main, though the term <hi>Moral Certainty, and Moral Infallibilitie,</hi> ſeems to me as vain and improper as it is modern: it upon enquirie, amounting to no more then the old Probabilitie well and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly grounded</p>
                     <p>The next thing in Holy Writ, is the much greater importance the things therein contained are of, above unwritten doctrines.

Some ('tis true) have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed between <hi>Dogmes</hi> of Traditions and doctrines of the Scripture, and haveaffirmed, That as well the one as the other ought to be received by a good Chriſtian. All this we agree to; how, we ſhall ſhow by and by more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and here by comparing this by the words of St. John, ſaying, <hi>This</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Commandment have we from him, that he that loveth God, love his brother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> By which it is not required that any Chriſtian ſhould with the ſame kind or degree of Love, love his neighbour, with which he loveth God. For we muſt love God only for his own ſake, and our brother for Gods ſake. Nay, when God ſayes we muſt love our neighbour as our ſelves, he does not exclude difference in degrees of love: In like manner, when it is ſaid, That we ought to believe and receive the unwritten as well as written traditions, it was never intended by that excellent Father, that we ſhould admit them in equal veneration. For moſt things there by him inſtanced in, are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently extrinſical to Faith. Therefore the true meaning is, That no good Son of the Catholick Church, can, or ought to refuſe the cuſtomes, or practices, or forms of words concerning the doctrine of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55232:39"/>
they are not ſo expreſſ'd or contain'd in Scripture as other matters are.</p>
                     <p>And if we mark, we ſhall not find any one thing exacted of Chriſtians in the pureſt and moſt flouriſhing ſtate of the Church, as points of Faith, which only depended upon unwritten Tradition; and were not thought to have the written word of God for their warrant and foundation. And in this one thing (were there no more) doth the prerogative of the Scripture mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it ſelf ſufficiently above Traditions diſtinct from it: That whatever vertue or credit they have, is firſt of all owing to the Scriptures. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, why ſhould not the Traditions of the Jew or Mahometan be as credible to a Chriſtian as they of the Church; but that he ſuck'd in his principle with his Mothers milk; That the written word of God hath given ſo fair teſtimonie of the Church and its traditions? For the teſtimonie of the Church otherwiſe, would certainly be no more to be valued than that of any other ſocietie, of like moral honeſtie. So that the Scriptures muſt be the very Firſt principle of all Chriſtian belief.</p>
                     <p>But here ſteps in the old objection drawn from a moſt eminent Father of the Church, which Extollers of tradition can as well forget their own names as leave out of their diſputations on this ſubject; though according to their<note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> cuſtome they have a very bad memory to bear in mind what hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently replied to it. I ſhould not, ſaith that Father, have believed the Scriptures but for the Church: and yet we have ſaid we ſhould not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Church but for the Scriptures. How can theſe ſtand together? Very well, if we pleaſe to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral wayes of information: for in the ſame there muſt be granted a repugnancie. And the diſtinction is much the ſame with what we have before laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Occaſion, and the direct Cauſe of Faith. For though the Churches tradition be an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the belief of the Scriptures, and ſuch a neceſſary Cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man ordinarily comes ſo much as to the knowledge of them: yet it doth not at all follow, that through the influence of that ſuppoſed Cauſe, an effect of Faith is wrought in the Soul concerning them; but from a ſuperiour illumination and interiour power, which has been generally<note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> required to ſuch praeternatural Acts. As the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> brought her fellow Citizens to Chriſt, but was not the author of that faith which after they had in him as the true Meſſias; or as the Horſe I ride on carrying me from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York</hi> is not the proper Cauſe that I ſee that City, but mine own ſenſes; though I perhaps ſhould never have ſeen it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>But another more Ancient and no leſs venerable Father of the Church is<note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note> here brought in, demanding, <hi>What if nothing had been written, muſt we not then have altogether depended on the Traditions?</hi> To ſuch as extend this quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie too far, I move the like queſtion. What if we had no Traditions at all; muſt not then every man have ſhifted as well as he could, and traded upon the finall ſtock of natural reaſon in him? Or was it impoſſible that man ſhould come to bliſs without the ſuperadded light outwardly exhibited? That as the caſe ſtands, man ordinarily cannot be ſaved without ſuch received revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are dealt to us from the Church, I believe: But upon ſuppoſal, that no ſuch means were extant, that there ſhould be no other Ordinary way of Gods revealing himſelf to man in order to his ſalvation, believe it who will, for me. I anſwer therefore directly, No queſtion but tradition would have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, if nothing had been committed to writing. For either God would have remitted of that rigour (as no man can doubt but he might have made the terms of the Covenant fewer, and lighter) with which we now ſtand obliged to him according to that moſt equal Law of the Goſpel, as well as

                        <hi>whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it probable, againſt the intent of Chriſts moſt excellent Parable, in St. <hi>Mathew:</hi> that of that Perſon, or that People to whom he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered but two, or five Talents, he ſhould extort the Effect of ten. Well therefore doth that Father argue againſt ſuch as ſhould dare to conſine God only to Scripture, and ſo ſuperciliouſly or contemptuouſly look on the Traditions of their Chriſtian Fathers, as not worth the ſtooping to take up; yea, as neceſſarily warring againſt the Word written: Whenas it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a thing is written becauſe it is firſt declared; and is the Word of him that ſpeaketh, no leſs before, than after it is written; and not ſo, becauſe it is written. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore joyns them both together, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Therefore brethren ſtand ſtedfaſt and hold</hi>

                        <hi>the Traditions, which ye have been taught, whether by word or our Epiſtle.</hi> Here are plainly both <hi>written</hi> Traditions, and <hi>unwritten;</hi> and <hi>written</hi> Word of God, and <hi>unwritten:</hi> and they differ only in the ſeveral ways of promulgation, and not in the Law of God. And it is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That thoſe firſt principles of Chriſtian Faith were not received of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in writing; of which he ſpeaks in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> concerning the Incarnation, Paſſion and Reſurrection of our Saviour, nor delivered in writing at his firſt publication; yet were no leſs the word of God then, than afterward.</p>
                     <p>Yet, as this ſufficiently allayes the heat of hoſtility indiſcreetly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt all Traditions, even for the very names ſake, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come odious to us; ſo doth it not ſo much favour the contrary party, as hath been phantaſi'd. For 'tis obſervable, That there is a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Tradition now touched, and that ſo commonly and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately diſputed of in the Church. That was, and may be called a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as every thing expreſſed by Word or Writing, whereby one man delivers his mind (for ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phraſe hath it, not amiſs) to another tranſiently: But the Tradition now under debate may be deſcribed, <hi>A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant continuation of what is once delivered, from Generation to Generation.</hi> For, No man can with any propriety of ſpeech, term what is not a year or two in ſtanding <hi>Tradition.</hi> Tradition is a long cuſtom of believing. The things which are ſo called in the Scriptures, are not ſuch; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no preſident for thoſe of theſe dayes. There being not the like reaſon, that we ſhould give the ſame reſpect, or eſteem ſo Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that which now is ſo reputed, and that which any mans memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might aſſure him was ſo in very deed the Apoſtles Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>This controverſie then ſeems to come to this iſſue. Firſt, in Reaſon, Whether Oral and Memorial Tradition can be ſo ſecure, as Scriptural? The reſolution of which doubt almoſt every man may make ſufficiently, of himſelf, and hath been competently treated of above.</p>
                     <p>The other Queſtion is about matter of Fact, Whether the Church of God did ever ſo unanimouſly agree in the neceſſity, validity or Sacredneſs of any Traditions not contained in the written Word of God, as to equal them with this? This we abſolutely deny: And upon the account of Tradition it ſelf: There being no ſuch Tradition to be found in all the Records of the Church; that Tradition is ſo highly to be valued. Again, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conſent ſufficient in the Church for many ages, That as to the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts of Chriſtian doctrine the Scriptures do ſufficiently inſtruct us, as a Rule, and Law of believing. For, If the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Law,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55232:40"/>
was ſufficient before the Prophets added to it, for the People of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Diſpenſation. And the Law and the Prophets were ſtill ſufficient till <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is to believed, That the Law of Chriſtians delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſts appointment ſhould fall ſhort of the ſame ends now? It is truly affirmed. That what St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth in commendation of Scripture, was intended chiefly, if not only of the books of the Old Teſtament, <hi>viz. That they were able to make a man wiſe unto Salvation through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> and, <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for doctrine, for correction, for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> Now, if the Scriptures of the Old Teſtamant were ſufficient to bring a man to the Faith of Chriſt, and to inſtruct him to Salvation, can any man reaſonably doubt, Whether the much clearer, and fuller manifeſtation of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and Salvation, by the books of the New Teſtament, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the ſame end, joyned to the obſcurer of the Old? I know there are that ſay expreſly, No: and endeavour to make it good by ſeveral inſtances very material to Faith; and yet not expreſſed in Scripture; and yet again, of force to be believed by all that would be good Chriſtians: As the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Trinity, and of Chriſts Perſon conſiſting of humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature: Of his being born of the bleſſed Virgin. Some other are added hereunto, but they are either ſuch as are neither favoured by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor good Tradition; as Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or have only a general warrant from Scripture and Tradition; and ſuch are they which are of a mutable nature, Rites and Ceremonies of the Church: which ought not, when confirmed by long conſent and uſe in the Church, lightly to be refuſed and caſt off; ſo when any Church, having power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its own body, ſhall think fit to alter, is that Church to be refuſed as a true Church, by others. But to the firſt of theſe, we ſtick not openly to profeſs, That it ſuffices to believe ſo much only as is really contained in, and ſoberly deducible from the Scriptures; taking theſe articles of Faith ſeparately from certain acceſſory obligations of all good Chriſtians. For inſtance. It is not required to believe the doctrine now eſtabliſhed in the Catholick Church concerning the Trinity, in the forms at preſent received from the nature of the Articles themſelves, which may with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſufficient be aſſented to, as they are ſimply found in Scripture: yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, That Hereticks have ſtirred up moſt dangerous and ſacrilegious doubts, to the obviating them, and ſecuring the main ſtake which would be endangered if farther explications were not found out and impoſed, it is needful to receive them alſo, or at leaſt not to oppoſe and declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. For 'tis very well known, there paſſed ſome ages before the Articles of the Trinity of Perſons were ſo much ſtood on, or ſo well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as now they are, and that Tradition was as much to ſeek as the written Word of God, to bring things to that paſs they now are in.</p>
                     <p>And for Chriſt's manner of birth, I know no ſuch Tradition either writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or unwritten which required antiently any more than to believe bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the eternal Son of God became man, and was incarnate, and born of a woman, who was a pure Virgin; but probable circumſtances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the high Myſtery of Chriſts Perſon obliged to the honorary part of that Article. And the like anſwer may be made to another inſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Paedobaptiſm, which ſome, as occaſion offers, will ſay is required in Scripture; and again, it ſerving at other times their turn better to deny<note place="margin">Bellarmin.</note>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55232:40"/>
it, will hold the contrary. For Baptiſm of Infants, as Infants, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed required by Scripture; but as perſons ſaveable, it is: the rule gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in Scripture running thus, <hi>Except a man be born of water and the Holy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John. 3. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Ghoſt he cannot be ſaved.</hi> It is not ſaid, unleſs a man be born by water, while he is an infant or Child, but abſolutely. For had it been ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, juſt doubt might have been made, whether a man baptized at his full age, were effectually baptized? Neither is Baptiſm appointed ſignally and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely for men in years (though none but ſuch at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel who could profeſs their Faith could be capable of it) but indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely is it ſpoken without any limitation; and therefore ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Other inſtances againſt the plenitude of Scripture as a Rule of Faith have either already been touched (as that which tells us, It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where contained in Scripture that the Scriptures are the word of God, neither can it be proved by it: for no more can it be demonſtrated by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) or may be eaſily brought to the ſame end.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this point, having ſhewed what we mean by Tradition, and what it ſerveth not to, it were unreaſonable to leave it ſlurr'd ſo, and not to give it its due in ſhewing the great uſe thereof in the Church of Chriſt. For however we make it not ſupream, nor coequal with the written word of God, it may without any offence or invaſion of Divine Right or Autoritie claim the next place to it; and as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be greater then all the the people beſides, but inferiour to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Throne. Of God it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſateſt in the Throne judging right.</hi> God now judges by his Word<note place="margin">Pſalm. 9. 4.</note> written, as by a Law and Rule of faith, as is ſhewed. Yet, I ſee no reaſon for the injudicious zeal and reverence of ſuch who think they cannot give enough unto the Scriptures, unleſs in word and pretence (for tis no more, themſelves conſtantly acting contrarie to their profeſſion) they aſcribe all the Form of Judging unto the Scriptures, and all things determinable to their deciſion. I wiſh with all my heart (ſo far am I from an evil eye or niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection towards Scripture) they could make their words good, when they tell us all things are contained in Scripture, It is a perfect Rule of all emergent doubts and acts in the Church, It is Judge and Law both of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; but alas, they cannot: For they take away from it more then by this rank kindneſs they give to it. Gods word is Perfect as a Law, and ſo far as he intended it: but it muſt ceaſe to be a Law and take another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it, if it were a Judge too in any proper ſenſe: And the Canon of Scripture muſt be it ſelf variable and mutable, if it could particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it ſelf to all occaſions and exigencies of Chriſtians. But this is not only abſurd, but needleſs. For God, when he made men Chriſtians, did not take away from them what they before had as Men, but required and ordained that humane judgement and reaſon ſhould be occupied and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his divine Revelations. He in brief gave them another, and far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Method, Aid, and Rule to judge by; and did not deſtroy, or render altogether uſeleſs their Judgement even in matters ſacred. <hi>To the Law and</hi>

The Records of the Church, like ſo many Preſidents, and Reports in our Common Law, giving us to underſtand Low<note place="margin">Conſuetudo eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in Civilibus rebus pro Lege ſuſcipitur, cùm deficit Lex; nec differt Scripturd, an ratione conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, quando &amp; Legem ratio commendet. <hi>Tertul. de coron. mil. cap. 4.</hi>
                        </note> ſuch places of Scripture were formerly underſtood, and on which ſide the caſe controverted paſſed. And why this courſe in divine matters ſhould not be approved, I ſee not, unleſs unquiet and guilty perſons ſhall ſeek, under colour of a more abſolute appeal to Scripture (which is here ſuppoſed to be ſincerely appealed unto before) to wind themſelves into the ſeat of Judicature, and at length, not only as fallibly, but alſo uſurpingly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for themſelves and others too. This event hath ſo manifeſtly appeared, that there is no denying of it, or defending it. They therefore who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly introduce Tradition, to the defeating and nulling of Scripture, deal indeed more broadly, and in ſome ſenſe more honeſtly, (as being what they ſeem) than they, who give all, and more then all due to it in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but in practiſe overthrow it. But we making Tradition abſolutely ſubordinate and ſubſervient to Scripture, and in a word, of the nature of a Comment and not of the Text it ſelf, we are yet to ſeek not what deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and paſſionately (for we know enough of that already) but ſoberly can be objected againſt it. For if it be ſaid, Tradition is it ſelf uncertain, it is obſcure, it is periſhed, it contradicts it ſelf, and ſo can be of little uſe: we readily joyn with them ſo far, as to acknowledge that ſuch tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to them to whom they ſo appear can with no good reaſon be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to: But we deny that there are none but ſuch; and that ſuch as prove themſelves to be true and honeſt men upon due trial and examination, ought to be hang'd out of the way, becauſe they were found in company with thieves and Cheats.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing then, That ſuch honeſt Traditions are to be found in the Church; another great benefit redoundeth to the Church from thence, in that it doth, in ſome caſes, ſupply the defects of the Law it ſelf, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But here, I muſt firſt get clear of this reputed Scandal given, in that I ſuppoſe the Scriptures defective, or imperfect: I have already, and do again profeſs its plenitude and ſufficiency, as far as a Rule or Law is well capable of. Now, what God by his infinite wiſdom and power might have done, I cannot queſtion, in contriving ſuch an ample Law as ſhould comprehend all future and poſſible contingencies in humane affairs; but this I ſay, That he diſpoſing things by another Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humane capacity and condition, never did, or ſo much as intended to deliver ſuch an infinite Law. Is not <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and his miniſtry to God, and the people, frequently alledged as a notable argument to convince us of the amplitude of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>was faithful in all his houſe:</hi> And therefore much<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 2.</note> more was Chriſt. Very good: and what of all this? As much as comes to nothing. For wherein did the faithfulneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> conſiſt? In pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out unmeaſurably all that might be ſaid touching divine matters: Or rather in delivering faithfully and exactly all that God commanded him? This truly did <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore was very true and faithful to him that ſent him, and gave him his charge. This did Chriſt, and this did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt, and his inſpired ſervants; and therefore were all no leſs faithful to God than <hi>Moſes.</hi> But did not <hi>Moſes</hi> leave more caſes untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Adminiſtration of the Jewiſh Policie, then were litterally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55232:41"/>
Yes ſurely; judging it ſufficient, that he had laid down gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules and Precepts, according to which, Emergencies (which might be infinite) ſhould, by humane prudence, be reduced, and accordingly determined. And ſo (chooſe they or refuſe they) muſt they grant did Chriſt, and his Inſtruments, leave the Law of the Goſpel; which yet not wanting all that can be expected from a Law, cannot modeſtly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced imperfect, notwithſtanding (as is ſaid) manifold particulars are not there treated of. Now thoſe are they we ſay, Tradition doth in ſome meaſure ſupply unto us; and the defect of Tradition it ſelf (which hath not conſidered all things) is made good by the conſtant power of the Church, given by the Scriptures themſelves, in ſuch caſes: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire determination of circumſtances of time, place, order, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods ſervice, according to the Edification of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving thus ſpoken of the Rule of Chriſtian Faith, and its Auxiliary, Tradition; we are now to proceed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Acts, the Effects, Subject, and Object of it. For as all Chriſtian Religion is ſummed up in one Notion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, ſo all Faith may be reduced unto the foreſaid Heads. Faith taken in its greateſt extent, containeth as well Humane as Divine: And may be defined, <hi>A firm aſſent of the mind to a thing reported.</hi> And there are two things which principally incline the mind to believe. The Evidence of the thing offered to the underſtanding, or the Fidelity and Veracity of him that ſo delivers any thing unto us. For if the thing be<note place="margin">Fides, est do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num divinitùs infuſum menti hominis, quae ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ullam haeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantiam credit eſſe veriſſima, quaecunque no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Deus per u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque Teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradidit ac pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſit. <hi>Eraſm. in Symbolum.</hi>
                        </note> apparent in it ſelf, to our reaſons or ſenſes, we preſently believe it: And if the thing be obſcure and difficult to be diſcerned by us, yet if we ſtand aſſured of the faithfulneſs of him that ſo reports it to us, and his wiſdom, we yield aſſent thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But Faith properly Divine hath a twofold fountain ſo conſtituting and denominating it, The Matter believed, which is not common nor natural, but ſpiritual and heavenly. But more eſpecially that Faith is Divine, which is not produced in the ſoul of Man upon any natural reaſons neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſame, but upon a ſuperior motive inducing unto it, that is,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55232:42"/>
Autoritie divine; and becauſe it hath declared and revealed ſo much unto us, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> believing Chriſt to be the Son of God, it is ſaid, <hi>Fleſh and Boood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</hi> This<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 17.</note> was a divine Faith upon a double reſpect. 1. by reaſon of the object, Chriſt, a divine perſon. 2. by reaſon of the Cauſe, God, by whoſe power he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the ſame, it not being in the power of fleſh and blood, any natural reaſon, to convince the judgement ſo far as abſolutely to believe, That Chriſt was ſo the Son of God, ſo that to be revealed is that which makes the Faith properly divine, and not the divine object or thing believed. For as it hath been obſerved by others, any thing natural, and which by natural reaſon may be demonſtrated and ſo muſt be believed by a natural Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo commended unto us upon divine autority or revelation may be alſo believed by a divine Faith. That there is an inviſible Deity is clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable from the viſible things of this World, and accordingly may and ought to be believed, upon the warrant of natural reaſon it ſelf, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us ſaying, <hi>The Inviſible things of him from the Creation of the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead: ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> That is, If God had not revealed all this, yet men ought to believe this, out of ſenſe and reaſon: but this hinders not, but this very thing ſhould become an article of our Creed alſo, and ſo, becauſe it is revealed, Form in us a divine Faith.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt be aware of an ambiguity in Revelation, which may miſlead us. For ſometimes Revelation is uſed for the thing revealed: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Act Revealing: that which we call now, <hi>The Revelation of St John,</hi> and in truth all Scriptures as we have them now, are the things God did reveal unto his ſervants, but the Act whereby they were revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or the Act revealing this to them, ended with the perſons receiving them.</p>
                     <p>And this is no ſuperfluous or curious obſervation, becauſe of a received maxim in the Schools, <hi>That without a ſupernatural act we cannot give due aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto a ſupernatural object, nor believe truths revealed by God without a ſuper added aid of Grace illuminating and inclining the mind to aſſent thereto.</hi> From whence doth follow, That, of all divine Faith is moſt properly, if not only divine, which doth believe that ſuch things are Revealed of God, and not, That, which ſuppoſes them to have been revealed by God, and that he ſaid ſo as is expreſſed unto us doth believe. For this latter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any natural man and greateſt infidel in the world would believe, who believes there is a God: it being included and implied in the very notion of a Deity, that God cannot lie or deceive, or affirm a thing to be, which is not. But the Chriſtian Faith mounts much higher then Heathens, and by the Grace of God believes that God hath <hi>Revealed</hi> ſuch things, wherein conſiſts his Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing then a true believer indeed muſt believe, is, That the Scriptures are the word of God; and this as it is the moſt fundamental, ſo is it moſt difficult of all to one not educated in the Faith of Chriſtians; becauſe it neither can be proved by Scripture, nor whatevermen, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe nothing leſs in their preſumptuous methods then clear demonſtrations, may ſay, and argue by Tradition: The Scriptures, (though not teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of it ſelf, yet) matter and manner may induce, and Tradition fortifie that; but the Crown of all true Chriſtian Faith muſt be ſet on by Gods Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55232:42"/>A Second thing in order, is, when we believe that God hath ſpoken ſuch things, that we believe the things themſelves ſo delivered to us of God.

                     <p>A third degree of Chriſtian Faith, is, When not onely we believe that God hath revealed his Law unto us, and what he hath ſo revealed to be moſt faithful, true, and holy; but obey the ſame. For in Scripture Faith is taken for Obedience, and Obedience for Faith; as in the famous inſtance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is ſaid to believe God, and that his Faith was counted for Righteouſneſs. And why is <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to believe God ſo ſignally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe he was perſwaded that God bade him offer up his Son unto him? No, but becauſe he did it by Faith, as is witneſſed in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews. And this acceptation of Faith is much confirmed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 17.</note> ſpeech of Scripture, in whoſe ſenſe, they who obey not God, are commonly ſaid not to believe him: as in the Book of Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Likewiſe when the Lord ſent unto you from Kadeſh-Barnea, ſaying, Go up and poſſeſs the Land which I have given you, then ye rebelled againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord your God, and believed him not, nor hearkened unto his voice.</hi> And therefore in the Acts of the Apoſtles it is ſaid, <hi>A great</hi>

                        <hi>company of the Prieſts were obedient unto the Faith.</hi> That is, believed what was Preached by the Apoſtles. And yet more expreſly St. <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe to the Romans declares this, where he ſaith, <hi>But unto them that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath.</hi> For no man can ſo properly be ſaid to <hi>Obey,</hi> as to Believe a truth.</p>
                     <p>But that diſtinction of greateſt moment to the illuſtrating of many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities, and ſolving many doubts ariſing to Chriſtian Readers out of the Scripture, and eſpecially St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, is that of Faith, into the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Faith or Object, and in ſum, the whole New Covenant as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the New Teſtament: And the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of Faith in a true Believer. The former is that which we are required to believe: The latter ſignifies the inward propenſion to the receiving the things ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Goſpel: And is again ſubdivided into Faith complexly, or generally taken, and ſpecially: that, as comprehending the whole duty of a true Believer, and all Chriſtian Graces flowing from that Fountain, and built upon that Foundation: This, as diſtinct from the two other Theological Graces, Hope and Charity; of all which St. <hi>Paul</hi> treateth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, in his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, concluding his thirteenth<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 13.</note> Chapter thus, <hi>And now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity.</hi> And that Faith is taken for the Doctrine of Faith, or of Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, is<note place="margin">Acts 6. 7.</note> very plain and very neceſſary to be noted; as in the place to the Romans even now touched: where, as Obedience is taken for the act of believing; Faith is taken for the Goſpel it ſelf: And in the ſame Book it is written that <hi>Felix ſent for Paul and heard him concerning the Faith in Chriſt:</hi> that<note place="margin">Acts. 24. 24.</note> ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>In the mean time, here preparing grounds for a more important diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it will not be amiſs to note other ſuppoſed kinds of Faith: of which four are vulgarly by modern Divines pitch't upon, as of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature and form. They are <hi>Hiſtorical Faith, Temporarie Faith,</hi> which laſt but for a ſeaſon, <hi>Miraculous Faith,</hi> ſeen in working of miracles. All which terms of Faith I without any more adoo, grant to have ground in Scripture as ſo many diſtinct Acts, but not kinds of Faith. They are very unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed as ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> becauſe ſeveral events or effects: they may be all brought under that of Juſtifying Faith, not as <hi>Species</hi> under their <hi>Genus,</hi> but as parts are reduced to the whole, or degrees inferiour, to the higheſt. For undoubtedly <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Faith, as they call it, whereby a man gives a general Credence or aſſent to what is delivered in Scripture, is a degree and good ſtep to that called Juſtifying Faith, and there is no Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith without it: And ſo are the Acts of a Temporary Faith, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Faith, acts of a Juſtifying Faith. For, as for the <hi>temporarineſs,</hi> or failing, it diſtinguiſhes Chriſtian Faith neither from Gentile, nor Jewiſh belief; nor true from falſe, but only as to the Event, that the one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and comes to perfection, and the other comes to untimely end. Which puts no more difference between the Juſtifying and not Juſtifying Faith: then the untimely death of a child does diſtinguiſh him from a man: which is in growth, not in nature; according to which all good diſtinctions ought to be made. For, if nothing be wanting to the denominating this failing Faith, a Juſtifying and ſaving Faith, but duration, how can they be thus reaſonably diſtinguiſhed? And as to the Faith producing miracles, it is the very ſame in nature with that which was required by our Saviour Chriſt, to have miracles wrought upon them that were by him miraculouſly cured, than which nothing occurs more frequently in the Goſpels: and is an act of Juſtifying Faith; as ſuppoſing the belief of Chriſt, according as the Goſpel deſcribes him, which as it ſhall be ſhewed preſantly, is the true Juſtifying Faith. For as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith in St. <hi>Mark, No man ſhall do a</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark. 9. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Miracle in my name that can lightly ſpeak evil of me;</hi> So that by Faith in Chriſt ſuch miracles being wrought, who can denie it to be the effect of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith? But that which may have deceived men, is an opinion, That what ever proceeds from a Juſtifying Faith, muſt needs proceed from it, as it juſtifies. For in truth, Miracles, or the gift of the working them, is not that which commends us to God, to our juſtification; but to men: and Graces rather than Gifts, both Sanctify and juſtify. Yet this hinders not, but Juſtifying Faith may be the ſpring from whence that Gift proceeds, and ſo not oppoſite to it. But it is here commonly ſaid, That Heathens and Reprobates may have the three ſorts of Faith, here oppoſed to Juſtifying Faith. But I muſt crave leave to denie, and declare their errour herein. For, It is a contradiction to ſay, A man can ſo much as Hiſtorically believe all the Goſpel, and yet continue an Infidel. The Devil therefore believing, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, (for his words are much ſtood upon in this Caſe) is no Infidel. And yet he, nor prophane Believers and reprobates are not true Chriſtians; not becauſe they have nothing faithful in them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this good ground and Juſtifying Faith Inchoate, being, as the Schools ſpeak, unformed, and deſtitute of a proportion of Charity and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                        </gap>e Juſtified. And Reprobates Faith may be true Faith, ſo much as they have of it, and ſo long as they hold it: For God forbid that their Faith ſhould make them Reprobates: It is their want of Faith in perfection, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance that ſo diſtinguiſhes them. For were not that Faith true, real, and and ſaving which they have, or had; they might be damned for having no Faith at all, but they cannot be damned for not continuing and growing in that Faith, as the Scriptures aſſure us ſome ſhall. And no more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant needs here be alledged than what St. <hi>Peter</hi> at large delivereth, 1 <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> C. 2. V. 13, 14. 15. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some add hereunto an Hypocritical Faith: which indeed muſt needs be quite of another kind, but what it is no man can tell further then from the negative notion, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not true Faith; and ſo no Juſtifying Faith, but a ſhadow of it, not the thing: but the foremention'd Faiths are, or may be, real and Good: but Hypocritical can never be ſo as <hi>Hypocritical.</hi> But we ſhall conclude this Chapter with an other obſervation, we conceive, has occaſion'd misbelief concerning Juſtifying Faith. For it is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly believed, That all Juſtifying Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt and doth neceſſarily and actually Juſtify all in whom it is: But that is not ſo, but that is truly Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith which in its own nature tendeth thereunto, though peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture defeated of its effect. For, if natural cauſes have not alwayes their proper effects through outward impediments, may it not be much rather the caſe of ſpiritual things which work not naturally, but freely?</p>
                     <p>To the former diſtinctions of Faith may be well added another; and that of Faith Explicite and Implicite, much inſiſted on, and therefore here to be conſidered. And it cannot be, neither is it denied, but really ſuch caſes there are in which good Chriſtians have not that plenitude of Faith deſirable, and in ſome caſes, neceſſarie. For otherwiſe, we muſt condemn the Faith of St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, ſo much commended by Chriſt himſelf;<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 16, 17, 18.</note> when he openly profeſſed the Deitie of our Saviour Chriſt. For not long after Chriſt ſharply rebuked him for his ignorance of this Paſſion of him;<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23:</note> ſaying, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me.</hi> And, ſo were the Diſciples ignorant of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and of the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, ſuppoſing his Kingdom ſhould be rather a Temporal than Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eternal; as appeareth by their Queſtion, <hi>Wilt thou at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore</hi>

                        <hi>again the Kingdom unto Iſrael?</hi> And I make no doubt, after ſo much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the Hiſtories of the Primitive times, that many Eminently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons ſuffering martyrdome for Chriſt, were very meanly ſeen, and ſetled in divers of thoſe Articles of Faith, which have been ſince impoſed as neceſſarie on the Church, and indeed ought to be. How this can be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is therefore to be inquired into. And to this end; Firſt, it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, what may be meant by <hi>Implicit,</hi> and <hi>Explicit</hi> Faith. That we call Explicit Faith, which clearly, diſtinctly, and expreſly believs an article of Faith, or any divine truth revealed. Implicit then, muſt be ſuch a Faith that believs obſcurely and confuſedly only. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is neceſſarie to diſtinguiſh this diſtinction it ſelf. For, Faith may be ſaid to be Implicit, either in reſpect of its object: or of its Act. The Firſt Impliciteneſs conſiſteth in this, That a Chriſtian believing ſome one material article of Faith clearly and expreſsly, may be ſaid to believe that which is included in that, and neceſſarily follows from it. As he that ſhall believe that Chriſt conſiſteth of a divine and humane nature, may be ſaid to believe that article contained, as it were, under it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55232:44"/>
had a humane will, as well as divine; though his ignorance be ſuch as never to have particularly conſidered the ſame. But the Act of Faith I call im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite, is when a man being, (as they ſay) a Chriſtian or Believer at large, and liking that Religion very well, ſhall without ſearch, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the principal points of Faith, ſhuffle all together, and conclude all (as he thinks) ſufficiently in this, That he believes as a good Chriſtian or Catholick believes; as the Church believes.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of theſe kinds of Faith muſt neceſſarily be allowed as good and laudable, provided it be not accompanied with an affected ignorance or ſloth, hindering a mans proficiencie in the Extent and Intention, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it. For ſurely this means the Holy Scripture, when it ſaith, <hi>I have fed you with Milk, and not with meat: for hitherto, ye were not able to bear it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 2. 1 Cor. 2. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>neither yet now are ye able.</hi> And again, <hi>Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wiſdom of this world,</hi> &amp;c. Which intimate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, That the ſervants of Chriſt imitating their Maſter herein, did not preſently pour forth all the ſeveral Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, and of Faith, but proceeding gradually laid firſt the foundation, Chriſt Jeſus, and according to the capacitie of their Converts, opened the reſt more Explicitly afterward. And I make no doubt but the obſcure and narrow Faith of the unlearned, being generally more ſincere and firm than that of the knowing and inquiſitive, ſhall lead them to Heaven, no leſs than that more ample: Chriſts equal proceedings being ſuch, as not to require the ſame of all, in quantitie of <hi>meaſure</hi> but of <hi>proportion</hi> to their ſtate, and his Gifts and Graces conferred on men.</p>
                     <p>But that other ſort of Faith which ſatisfies it ſelf with the ſincerity and Catholickneſs of it, and that it is of ſuch a ſort, not attending to or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring after any further illumination, or information in the branches ariſing from that root, we cannot ſee how men can ſpeak reaſonably, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably in the commendation of it, or ſuch who are owners of it, can hope to receive any greater benefit, than to be numbred amongſt true Believers without the reward. For, it is expreſly againſt Gods word, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the <hi>Word of God ſhould dwell in you richly in all wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. And<note place="margin">

                        </note> the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the obedience of Faith (of which before) is generally proportionable to the Faith it ſelf from whence it ſprings. How then can any man act (as all men are tied) with an univerſal obedience, who know not nor believe what they are obliged to do, but by that Faith which is wanting in them? And rudely and effectedly to reſt quietly under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginarie protection of believing as the Church believes, may indeed keep men (which is all commonly lookt after, here) from being Hereticks, but it doth not ſecure them from being Heathens. For, what ever is ſaid and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſuch ignorant perſons do not believe as the Church believes. For when the Church believes Expreſly, and they believe confuſedly, do they believe as the Church believes? When the Church believes ſhe knows what, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they know not what, do they believe as the Church believes? Laſtly, when the Church believes directly and poſitively things as they are propounded, and theſe believe negatively, that, is no otherwiſe then the Church, not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitely to the ſenſe of it, do they believe as the Church believes? May not a Heathen believe no otherwiſe then the Church, and yet be an Heathen? Nay, the more naturally ſtupid and indocil men are, the ſafer Catholicks they ſhould be, becauſe they do not believe contrary to the Faith of the Church. It may be ſaid that Baptiſm alone is ſufficient to diſtinguiſh ſuch implicit believers from Heathens: which I grant, as to the Eſſence or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

So that the works of natural men may be good, though heathens; ſuch as are, Viſiting the ſick, and relieving the poor, defending the Fatherleſs and widow oppreſſed: and eſpecially ſuch outward moral Acts as may be done by natural men tending to their Converſion and Salvation, as willing hearing, and equal judging of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, even before actual Faith conceived: for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> eſteemed the <hi>Bereans</hi> praiſe worthy*. So that they are not abſolutely <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Sins:</hi> for were it ſo, they were by no means to be done, and no man did well, who, before his Converſion, went to hear Chriſt preach; or gave any attentive ear to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, or taught, for want of Faith: whereas we are taught by common reaſon, as well as by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Faith it ſelf cometh by hearing of the word of God. For how can any man poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly believe what he never heard of?

There may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be diſtinguiſhed a fourfould goodneſs in Actions. 1. Natural, when a man acteth agreeable to the perfection of the Rule of natural Beings, as a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55232:45"/>
man acteth agreeable to the perfection of the Rule of natural Beings; as a man is ſaid to walk well, when he goes according to the nature of man, and limps not, nor halts: and to write a good hand, when his letters and words do anſwer exactly a Perfect Rule or Copie. This, Religion taketh no notice of at all. 2. A man is ſaid to do a Good Act when it is ſo morally, and in its kind, as tending to the honour of his Creator, whoſe Inſtruments meer Moral men are, in exerciſing his Paternal providence; and to the benefit of others. For, it being the proper Character of God which is ſpoken of him by the <hi>Pſalmiſt, viz. Thou art Good and thou doeſt Good.</hi> They whom God<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 68.</note> chooſeth and ſtirreth up to miniſter under him in good and uſeful things to the Communitie or any particular, do that which is good; however not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. 3. There is a Religious or divine goodneſs in Actions, which are done agreeable to the Revealed Will of God, paſſing natures ſagacitie or ſearch. And this is twofold, Legal and Evangelical, both exceeding the former, but the one exceeded of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Legal of Evangelical.<note place="margin">Vere enim, quando decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namus d malo &amp; facimus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, quantum ad comparatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem caeterorum hominum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentium decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare à malo &amp; facere bonum, dicuntur bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na quae agimus: quantum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ad Verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ſecundum quod dic itur in hoc loco, <hi>Quia unus eſt bonus,</hi> bonum noſtrum non eſt bonum. <hi>Orig.

                        </note> For as Natural Acts are good, done according to natures intention and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by themſelves; but are not good compared with moral duty performed: and moral Acts are Good in themſelves, but not ſo in reſpect of a Superiour Order and end of working inſtituted of God in his holy Law; So are Legal Acts wrought according to Gods word given to the Iſraelites under that diſpenſation or Covenant as required of God, and ſerving to thoſe ends God propounded to himſelf and his people. Wherefore it is that the Children of Iſrael revolting from God, and forſaking that inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſhip of his Law, are thus cenſured by the Prophet <note n="*" place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 3.</note>

                        <hi>The Law is good if a man uſeth it Lawfully.</hi> (And the Goſpel it ſelf is not good unleſs uſed Lawfully:) Therefore were the works of the Law alſo, good works, within their bounds; but not ſo compared with the Perfection of the Goſpel; but diſpleaſing to God and pernicious to men, who being delivered in the fulneſs of time, by the coming of Chriſt from the Pedagogie and beggerly Elements of the Moſaical Law, ſhould preſume to retain that vail which was done away in Chriſt, and embrace thoſe ſhadows, the body Chriſt being preſent. Hence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> as in many other places, writing to the Corinthians, ſpeaketh thus at large,—<hi>The Letter killeth</hi> (i. e. the Literal ſenſe and obſervation of the<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> Old Law, after the New became of force, deſtroyeth rather than ſaveth the obſerver of it;) <hi>but the Spirit,</hi> (i. e. the Spiritual Law) <hi>giveth Life. But if the miniſtration of death, written and graven in Stones, was glorious, ſo that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                        <hi>the Children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly behold the face of Moſes for the glory of his Countenance, which glory was to be done away: How ſhall not the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi>

So, be the Law in it ſelf, and for that ſeaſon, and for that people, glorious and good; yet upon the approach of the Goſpel and its being in force, all that periſhed and the works thereof no longer good works, much leſs juſtifying, becauſe they were not done in Faith: not in the Faith of Chriſt, but in the Faith of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal then, yea only Good works that are now of any account as to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute acceptation at Gods hands, are thoſe which are done in an Evangelical manner.

So that if we ſhould deſcribe Good works of Chriſtians, we may call them, Acts, done in the Faith of Chriſt, according to the tenor of the Goſpel, as a Rule directing us to the manner and End of working.</p>

                     <p>SUppoſing then, that there are ſuch works which both God and man eſteem Good; it is next to be ſought into, how far their Goodneſs does extend: and of what efficacie they are, or what are the Effects of them. Remembring withall, that here, Faith is no way excluded, but advanced rather: ſeing Good works being the Effects of Faith the Effects of Good works muſt of neceſſity be likewiſe the Effects of Faith; as the fruit ows no leſs to the Root, which gives life and growth to the whole tree, than it doth to the branch from which it immediately proceeds. Yet is it here to be noted, anſwerable to what is ſaid before, That all good works do not proceed from Faith. For the works of the Gentiles have a real goodneſs in them, and that much more than they of the Jew, as they are Jewiſh; and yet not done in Faith, nor attaining to the <hi>Decorum</hi> or perfection of the Goſpel, and therefore frequently called ſinful, and no ways conducing directly to ſalvation, or Juſtification, as do the works
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55232:46"/>
wrought in Faith. I ſay directly, becauſe as in nature a man is ſaid to live the Life of a ſenſible Creature before he come to the perfection of humane nature: ſo may there be a preparatory or previous goodneſs in the works of Infidels, which may diſpoſe to, not merit the life or form of Faith. But becauſe the Regeneration, called ſometimes the <hi>Creation</hi> of the New man to ſhew the abſoluteneſs and independence of the Divine power and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuch Acts, doth not proceed as nature doth: For that which may be as prediſpoſing, is not ſimply requiſite to the introducing the form of Spiritual Life: but by the moſt free and powerful providence, many are elected and brought to Spiritual Life, without any ſuch previous goodneſs. And if we ſhould grant natural or moral Juſtice were neceſſary as an Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to Faith, it would not follow that it were ſo by way of merit, or diſpoſing God to perfect that rude beginning, with the acceſſion of his Grace. For, we are to make a neceſſary difference between Preparation to Grace, ſo much talked of. For there is a preparation of a mans ſelf, or the ſubject which is to receive this holy impreſſion: and there is a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Agent which conferrs this, by moving or inclining him to ſuch an End. I ſuppoſe the Schools, and ſeverer aſſertors of the Freeneſs of Gods Grace, to which a man cannot by acts of nature diſpoſe himſelf, do mean the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> that no man by any principle of nature, or habits of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue acquired and exerciſed according to the Rules of Juſtice and wiſdom, can thereby be ſaid to have done any thing which of it ſelf might incline God to regenerate him by his Grace. For it ſeems to me, keeping to the Rules and ſenſe of Scripture, as unlikely that a Chriſtian ſhould be author any more of Spiritual Life, than a man is of his Natural: But no man can with any ſenſe be ſaid to contribute to his natural Life, no more can he to his Spiritual Life, which is commonly called the <hi>Firſt Grace.</hi> But that the natural man, living ſoberly, Juſtly and temperately, is not thereby in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter readineſs, and leſs diſtant from the divine Grace perfecting the ſame, were hard to affirm; as well conſidering the method that God uſually takes (though not alwaies, nor is bound to any,) is to proceed, not <hi>per ſaltum</hi> (as they ſay) or from one extream to another, on the ſuddain; but by apt gradations, as the encouragement is from hence given to immortality it ſelf. And yet, as wood being orderly laid can never thereby merit or claim a kindling; or as a conveiance of a great Mannor being fully and fairly drawn can never deſerve, nor ſo much as for its ſake, diſpoſe the Lord whoſe it is, to paſs it away by ſetting his hand and ſeal to it: ſo neither can any fair hand of natural works induce God to conferr on a man the State of Grace. For this Paſſive preparedneſs we ſpeak of, doth not ſo much as either open the eye to diſcover the uſe or benefit of Grace, nor in the leaſt incline the Will to deſire it. Now becauſe the holy Fathers, and eſpecially St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and moderner Divines, do ſpeak of the Works of the Unregenerate, as not only inſufficient and imperfect, but ſinful, yea ſin; it is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to take their true meaning: which cannot poſſibly be, as if they were ſimply evil, for then were they ſimply to be forborn and omitted; but Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdochically, they intend alwayes to intimate a ſinfulneſs in defect, of what was due to ſuch Actions, compared with the divine Rule. Or they called them Sin, not ſo much from the nature of the Actions themſelves, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable evil of Commiſſion alwayes accompanying them; as was Pride and preſumption upon their ſuch laudable works; as ſufficing of themſelves without a Saviour or Sanctifier Extraordinarie, which they were either wholly ignorant of, or contemptuouſly rejected, to intitle them to exact

And I would to God that though no good Chriſtian can deny the uſefulneſs of Good works in general, that do not denie the Scriptures or common ſenſe, yet they would be more firmly ſetled in the belief hereof than too many are, and ſuffer this Faith to have its proper influence upon their lives, which might be ſafely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that without any offenſe or prejudice to the freeneſs of Gods grace, as will yet further appear.</p>
                     <p>For the Effect of Good works doth not only confine it ſelf to certain temporal bleſſings of this world, and outward proſperties, which in truth was the proper portion and promiſe made by God to the Jew, under the Old Law (ſo far as it was Ritual and Moſaical) upon their obedience; but it extendeth it ſelf plainly to the ſpiritual bleſſings upon earth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal in heaven, as our bleſſed Lord expreſly teaches us in his Sermon on the mount, ſaying, <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

Or how can any man affirm that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly taught and eaſily to be underſtood in Scripture, and ſhall denie this to be plain, and ſuch good works as are here ſpecified, neceſſarie to ſalvation? For to bring in any Scholie which ſhall elude this, will do them much more miſchief in other caſes, as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the corrupting all places of Scripture, which they allow to be plain, and rendring them altogether uſeleſs to the ends for which they are alleadged. For, to ſay only that Faith muſt be here underſtood, is moſt true, but inſufficient to make the teſtimonie void; becauſe otherwiſe, they were not good works. And this muſt alwayes be retained in memory which we have before laid as a foundation, That they are not the good works of natural Reaſon, or humanity, nor the good works of the Law now voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded which we here in this diſpute contend for; but they are the works of Faith qualified with all the due conditions of the Goſpel of Grace, and actuated by the Spirit of Grace.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A third thing requiſite to conſtitute a work Good according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is, that it proceed from a Perſon adopted or made a Child of God by Grace. For, this is required of all true Chriſtians; That they be <hi>born again of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John. 3. 5. Joh. 3. 9.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>A fourth, is the inward Grace of God working and moving the mind to holy works: and this preventing us, ſo that we are firſt excited of Gods Spirit without any natural inclination of our own to do that which is the good and acceptable will of God. For to this end make our Saviours words in the Goſpel, where he ſaith, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> that<note place="margin">1 Joh. 15. 5.</note> is, no Good work anſwerable to the perfection of the Goſpel, and the promiſes thereof.</p>
                     <p>A fifth, is the outward Grace of God remitting and paſſing over the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">Omnia manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta facta depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur quando quicquid non fit agnoſcitur. <hi>Aug. Retract.</hi>
                        </note> defects and blemiſhes adhering to Good works, even of the Regenerate. For then (ſaith an holy Father truly) is the Law fullfilled, when what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amiſs, is pardoned: And to this relate the words quoted in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrews, as an ingredient into the Covenant of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>I remember no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Perſeverance in good is likewiſe neceſſarie, though not to the eſſence of the Act done, to make it Good, (for perſeverence doth not of it ſelf add good or evil to an action, but ſuppoſes the ſame, and continues it as it finds it) yet to the reward it is abſolutely neceſſarie. Foraſmuch as Gods Judgement, as mans likewiſe, is alwayes paſſed according to what a man actually is found to be, whether good or evil, and not to what a man hath been, or poſſibly afterwards might have been. For, ſaith the word of God, <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> And<note place="margin">Revel. 2. 10. 1 Cor. 7. 8.</note> elſewhere, <hi>Waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs unto the day of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, to make a good Work rewardable, is requiſite the freeneſs of Gods promiſes made to accept the ſame, and to reward it, not for its own ſake, but for his ſake, and Chriſts ſake. And that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed bleſſed rewards to thoſe that work according to the tenour of the

Goſpel, as now deſcribed; doing it as his children, under the protection of Chriſts mediation and merits, to the glory of God, through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods Spirit, perſevering therein, till God ſhall call them off; reſting not upon themſelves, but his promiſes; is moſt undeniable, and a Principle neceſſary to be maintained and practiſed by all faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, doth appear from what is before alleadged. And what (if any thing may be) is yet more cleerly aſſerted by Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>He that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 12.</note>

                        <hi>only in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay unto you he ſhall in no wiſe looſe his reward.</hi> And in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>But love your enemies and do good</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>and lend hoping for nothing again, and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the Children of the Higheſt. For he is kind unto the unthankful and evil.</hi> Here, beſides the poſitive promiſes, is added a reaſon to aſſure all that ſhall do good works, that great ſhall be their reward: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy is ſuch that he imparteth of the ſame unto the wicked, he doth good unto the ill-deſerving and ſhall he not much more do good to thoſe that are good, and abound in Good works? To aſcribe therefore ſo much to a modern notion of Faith as many do (though the Learneder favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of it cloſely dealt with, are conſtrained to depart from this new rigour, as I could ſhow by divers inſtances) as to divide it from it ſelf, that is, the works of Faith, from Faith; the fountain in order to Juſtification, and Sanctification, and Salvation, is in effect to denie the Chriſtian Faith, and introduce one of their own invention, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, and reproach of Chriſtian Faith; which conſiſteth in theſe two things principally, <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> and a <hi>Glorious reward.</hi> And now leaſt ſome prejudiced mind may ſuppoſe that I have ſtated this point too favourably to the Roman ſenſe, and injuriouſly to the Franckneſs of Gods grace and mercy, in relation both to our Sanctification and Juſtification, and alſo to the vertue and efficacie of Faith in order to them, I ſhall end this diſcourſe with the Stating of this cauſe as I find it by <hi>Vortius</hi> a moſt ſevere and rigid Calviniſt: as they call ſuch men, in this negative<note place="margin">Vort. diſput. Select. Part. 2. p. 728. 726.</note> way. <hi>The Controverſie therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>between us and the Papacie. Firſt is not Whether good works are to be done; For, we affirm it. 2. Neither whether they be neceſſary and profitable to ſalvation: we affirm both. 3. Neither whether they are pleaſing to God, which we affirm. 4. Nor whether God grants a Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Reward to them. For, we affirm it, 5. Nor whether it be lawful to do good works with an eye to the reward; We ſay ſo. 6. Nor yet whether good works are ſins; we ſtoutly deny. 7. Nor laſtly, Whether the juſt be worthy of a Crown; For this we yield, with this limitation, Not out of their own worth, but the worthineſs of God,</hi> &amp;c. And if all this be honeſtly and fairly agreed to, I ſee no reaſon to fear the empty cavils and vain exceptions of ſome men, who have run themſelves they can ſcare well tell whether themſelves, from Popery: but I may venture to tell, Why? <hi>viz.</hi> Partly out of a blind implicite Faith in the Teachers they raiſe to themſelves: and partly to ſave their Credit and purſes by a ſtrange and monſtrous notion of Faith, rather then their ſouls. But the main block of Offenſe taken, not given, by this doctrine, ſeems to be an opinion of Merit favoured hereby. Of this therefore we ſhall ſpeak next.</p>

                     <p>TO merit is of a very various and ambiguous ſenſe, among the the Ancients humane and divine. It were ſuperfluous to note all, and to omit all, injurious to our preſent deſign.

                        </note> It is likewiſe frequently uſed by humane and Eccleſiaſtical Authors for to <hi>obtain</hi> or <hi>acquire</hi> only by juſt and due endeavours, without any juſt deſerts of the Partie ſaid to merit, but rather of Grace and favour of him who hath appointed and promiſed freely to reward ſuch actions as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and aſſigned with ſuch ends and remunerations, which far exceed the proportion or value of the work. For, ſurely in publick and antient Games (from which practice St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath borrowed many a Metaphor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the ſervice and contention of Chriſtians in the ſervice of God) to outrun, and prevent by footmanſhip, him that was matcht with one, did not properly deſerve ſuch a vaſt reward as was uſually conferred on him who excelled his Fellow: (For what title of juſtice can the haſting to take a crown give to him that receives it?) yet was he ſaid to deſerve it, and that either comparatively, becauſe he in reaſon ought to be preferred before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other that came behind him; and therefore merit it rather than he. Or becauſe the Authors of ſuch rewards having ſolemnly and fairly quitted all their Rights, and by publick promiſe ſetled the ſame upon other, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conditions they ſhall judge fit, there is a conditional Right thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon others: yet not out of the worthineſs of the acts leading to the accquiring the ſame. But a third notion of merit implies ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Act, and the end or recompence, that it were no leſs than unjuſt and unreaſonable for him who is concerned in the reward to denie it to him, or detain it from him, the work being accompliſhed. It being a Principle of common juſtice what Chriſt pronounces as Chriſtian reaſon too, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his hire:</hi> i. e. he merits it. And therefore<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 7.

                     <p>The principal enquiry then, is about the works of ſuch as acknowledge a Freeneſs of promiſe in God, (as moſt, or all Chriſtians do) what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may bear to the reward ſo freely promiſed? And in truth, there ſeems no leſs then a contradiction, after an acknowledgement of the freeneſs of a promiſe infinitely exceeding the labour or work, made to impute the reward rather to the work, than to the promiſe. For he that cannot merit the cauſe abſolutely required to the effect, cannot be ſaid to merit the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo that he who proteſts againſt the ſufficiency of his work to merit the promiſe, can have no tolerable pretenſion to merit the effect. Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith againſt ſuch as may glory in their works, <hi>Where is boaſting</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay, But by the Law of Faith.</hi> And yet in the two more favourable and leſs proper ſenſes above ſpecified, may a man, without prejudice to Gods free Grace, or Faith on Chriſt, be ſaid to merit; there being more exotiqueneſs to Scripture Phraſe, and harſhneſs to ears tender of Gods free Grace, than guilt in that word. For firſt, who can denie that he is the ſervant of God (that he is) according to the vow in baptiſm, a Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt; that he ſerves under him in the work of the Goſpel, againſt the world, and fleſh, and Devil, to the encreaſe of Grace and vertue according to Godlineſs? This is to merit many times with the ancient, without any implication of obligation upon God or Chriſt towards us for our ſervice.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond acceptation then is cheifly to be diſcuſſed, which allows not only a ſervice, but an efficacie to Good works ſo far as to render them capable of ſuch a term as <hi>Merit.</hi> For there is a wide difference between a

So then, ſuppoſing that upon works evangelical reward certainly follows of courſe, of Gods promiſe, vet this glory is not to be aſſumed to the Inſtrument, but Principal cauſes moving thereunto: which are three, principally ariſing and over-ruling a Chriſtian. The inward Grace of Gods ſpirit in reſpect of man working: The Indulgence of God in remitting the rigour of the Law, according to whoſe exactneſs the work is to be, but ſeldom or never is performed: And the promiſe of God condeſcending to ſuch low and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable terms in beſtowing his rewards. So that notwithſtanding (as is ſaid) there be certainly an efficacy (which ſometimes the holy Fathers call merit) in Good works, there is never found a ſufficiencie or ſuch a worth in the beſt Chriſtians actions, which may be commenſurate to our Salvation. For though (as many of the reformed have truly ſpoken) we be ſaved <hi>by</hi> our Good works; we are not ſaved <hi>for</hi> our Good works; no more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved and Juſtified <hi>by</hi> our Faith we are Juſtified <hi>for</hi> our Faith, as ſhall be ſeen by and by.</p>
                     <p>So then, all the merit of a true Chriſtian conſiſts in this, That being by Faith built upon that ſure and only foundation, beſides which none can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>We are ſaved, Not by Works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renuing of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> Yet this we are not capable of ſo freely, but <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note>

                        <hi>he might be Juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Is it not here as plain as words need make it, that the Apoſtle concerneth the juſtice of God in the juſtification of him that believeth? How then can theſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, but by diſtinguiſhing a twofold Juſtice in God, in reference to the work of Man: An abſolute or antecedent Juſtice, before his promiſe freely made; and a conſequent conditional Juſtice, ſuppoſing a free ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made by God, which never could be deſerved, neither is deſerved by the completion of the terms to which Man ſtands obliged to God. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns them both together, thus conſidered, without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of contrariety: For, ſaith he to the Theſſalonians, <hi>It is a righteous</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>thing</hi> (and that is no leſs then juſt) <hi>with God, to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you: And to you who are troubled, reſt with us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But ſome have ſaid concerning the reward in ſuch caſes, as holy, faithful working, promiſed, that it is promiſed to the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and not to the <hi>Work.</hi> Which if it were ſo, as upon tryal would ſcarce prove ſo; what an evaſion doth this prove? Seeing, in ſuch caſes, it is moſt abſurd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and oppoſe thoſe two which are inſeparable. For, God neither doth reward the work without the perſon, neither the perſon without the work: but the perſon working, as the perſon believing. Therefore, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith,</hi> he declareth his holy Life and good works: and when he addeth, <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Lord the Righteous</hi> (or juſt <hi>Judge</hi> as the old Tranſlation had it) <hi>ſhall give me at that day, and not unto me only but unto all them alſo that love his appearing;</hi> doth ſufficiently implie an inſeparableneſs of the perſon from the work: and that which puts the perſon into a capacity of the reward or Crown, is the dutifulneſs of the perſon towards God. So that there muſt of neceſſity be a Cauſality in good deeds, in order to our Salvation: though conſidering the moſt vulgarouſneſs of the word <hi>merit,</hi> and not the ſenſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the aboveſaid qualifications, it is both immodeſt and unſafe to applie the ſame to Acts which are Good neither for their own ſake, nor for the Agents ſake, but for Chriſts ſake, and the liberal promiſe ſake of God. So that to ſay, That Chriſt merited that we might merit, is very improperly, as well incroachingly, ſpoken upon the Grace of God: but to ſay, That Chriſt merited to the end we might effectually work out our Salvation, is to ſay no more then St. <hi>Paul</hi> intendeth in his Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians; where he affirmeth that <hi>God hath not appointed us to wrath: but to obtain Salvation by</hi>

                        </note> reference to good Works: as the Parable of our Saviour in the twenty fifth of Mathew plainly informs us: where it is ſaid, <hi>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the ſame and made them other five talents.</hi> Theſe five talents acquired to the firſt five, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be interpreted, the reward ultimate; for that is expreſſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be the <hi>Joy of the Lord:</hi> but they were the intermediate effects of the ſtock of Grace treaſured up in the Soul, and exhorting and improving it ſelf by the continual ſupplie of the Spirit of Chriſt, according to the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25. 16.</note> doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, ſaying, <hi>Inſomuch that we deſired Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, that as he had begun, ſo he would alſo finiſh in you the ſame Grace alſo: Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in Faith, in utterance, in knowledge, and</hi>

                        <hi>Head from which all the body by joints and bands having nouriſhment, miniſtred and knit together, encreaſeth with the encreaſe of God.</hi> Sanctification then may be deſcribed The Grace of God infuſed into the Soul of a Sinner, and purifying it by Faith: as Juſtification is the reputation and acceptation of a perſon for Juſt by almighty God, through the intuition of the merits and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt: And yet more diſtinctly to declare their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al agreement and difference, it will conduce much to the due underſtanding of them both.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, Juſtification and Sanctification agree in their Subject The true believer, the ſame perſon who is Sanctified being alſo Juſtified; and he that is Juſtified being Sanctified alſo: For ſo ſaith the prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> of him. <hi>The Lord is ſlow to anger and great in power and will not at all acquit the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nahum. 1. 3.</note> And when we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirming the contrary in appearance, <hi>viz.</hi> that God <hi>juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> we are to underſtand him to ſpeak not in<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> [<hi>Senſu compoſito</hi>] in ſuch manner that he is juſtified, while he is ſo ungodly, but in [<hi>Senſu diviſo</hi>] a diſtinct ſenſe and ſeaſon, as if it had been ſaid.

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Sanctified, but ye are Juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Secondly, Juſtification and Sanctification agree in their foundation, which is at leaſt inchoate, and initial holineſs. For, though no mans inherent holineſs ariſes ſo high as to denominate him truly Juſt, or holy, for its own ſake; yet both to Sanctification and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is neceſſarily required ſome preparatorie and imperfect holineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting principally in the Converſion of the mind to God, from ſin. Thirdly, both Sanctification and Juſtification are alike owing to Faith, as their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſe, next under Gods Spirit; as may be gathered from the prayer of Chriſt for his diſciples: <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 17 17.</note> 
                        <hi>truth:</hi> That is the doctrine of Faith, received. To which Faith, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Sanctification is aſcribed by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Acts, whereby the<note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note> hearts of the Gentile were purified or Sanctified. Fourthly, they are both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually imputed unto us through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Therefore ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, <hi>To them that are Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> And<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2. Heb. 10. 29.</note> to the Hebrews, it is ſaid, <hi>We are Sanctified by the blood of the Covenant.</hi> So that no leſs are we Sanctified then Juſtified by Chriſts death and merits, and the imputation of them.</p>
                     <p>But on the other ſide, they are diſtinct in ſome formalities; ſuch as theſe may be; for Firſt, the immediate cauſe of our Sanctification is in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture imputed to the operation and influence of the Holy Spirit, as our Juſtification is more properly attributed to Chriſt the mediator between God and man: As appeareth from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words to the Theſſalonians. <hi>But we are bound to give thanks alwayes for you brethren beloved of the Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation, through Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter. Elect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>

For not only is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Spirit of Regeneration and Sanctification purged from the old Leaven of ſin and malice, but he becometh a <hi>New Lump,</hi> and unleavened;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7. Rom. 6. 13.</note> and whereas he hath <hi>yielded his members as Inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, he doth yield himſelf unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead. And old things are done away in him, and all things become new.</hi> And <hi>whoſoever is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> (thus) <hi>born of God; doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Fourthly, to the Act of our Juſtification the will of man doth not neceſſarily concurr, though it diſſents not, but is rather paſſive than Active; but to our Sanctification is abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the co-operation of the will and affections of man with the Grace of God, in all thoſe who have attained unto the uſe of reaſon. For indeed by baptiſm Infants are ſo far Sanctified as to be freed from that hereditarie evil incident unto them, which their will concurred not to: but to actual San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification from thoſe evils our wills did freely conſent, actual concurrence of our wills is neceſſary, Fifthly, Our Juſtification is entire and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute at once; no man being partly Juſtified and partly not Juſtified, though he be partly Juſt and partly unjuſt or unholy: But no man in this Life is ſo perfectly Sanctified as that there wants not ſomewhat to conſummate the ſame; becauſe Juſtification being altogether the Act of God, and not at all of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55232:51"/>
Man, God may, and doth wholly and freely remit the guilt of ſin to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent offendor: But Man being alſo concerned in the Sanctification of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his acts are imperfect and defective, ſo that the effect it ſelf partakes of the ſame, and ſo Sanctification continues imperfect. And it is not all at once, but anſwerable to our natural man proceedeth by degrees, <hi>Until we all come</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph: 4. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledg of the ſon of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> which fulneſs of ſtature is that we are to hope for, and enjoy only in heaven. Laſtly, to ſearch no farther into this point, before Juſtification there muſt of neceſſity goe ſome degree of Sanctification, even in the opinion of ſuch as contend moſt rigorouſly for freeneſs of Juſtification: for to make Juſtification alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inconditionate, and abſolute on mans part, is to blaſpheme the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Juſtice of God, and withall, deſtroy the uſe of Faith in order to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: For it is impoſſible any thing bearing the name of a cauſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as Faith certainly doth, when we ſay <hi>We are Juſtified by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> but the Execution and performance of this promiſe is not made before there be an actual fulfilling of our Covenant with God. But then on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, there muſt be perfect Juſtification before there can be that perfect Sanctification, which we all aſpire unto, and God expects from us. For then are we truly Sanctified, when our works are holy and acceptable unto to God, which they are not untill they proceed from a perſon ſo far Juſtified as to be accepted of God. Whence may be reſolved that doubt, about Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the perſon for the works ſake, or the work for the perſons ſake. For wiſely and truly did the wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> inferr Gods acceptation of their ſacrifice from the favour and grace he bore unto their perſons: and at the ſame time prove the favour God bore to their perſons from the Acceptance of their ſacrifice, ſaying, <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kil us, he</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judg. 13. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>would not have received a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering at our hands; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he have ſhewed us all theſe things, nor would, as at this time, have told us ſuch things as theſe.</hi> That God therefore accepted their Burnt-offering, it is a ſign he approved their perſons, but the reaſon antecedent of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of their ſacrifice, was becauſe he firſt approved their perſons. And yet, notwithſtanding the goodneſs of the perſon is the original of the goodneſs of the work, nothing hinders but the goodneſs of the work may add value, favour, and eſtimation unto the perſon. As (to uſe <hi>Luthers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and others after, and before him) the tree bears the fruit, and not the fruit the tree: And the goodneſs of the tree is the cauſe of the goodneſs of the fruit, and not the goodneſs of the fruit the cauſe of the goodneſs of the tree: Yet the fruit doth procure an eſteem and valuation from the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the tree; and endears it to him, to the cultivating the ground and dreſſing, it and conferring much more on that than others. In like manner, the Perſon Sanctified and Juſtified produces good works, and not thoſe good works, him: but ſome actions accompanied with Gods grace, antecedent and inferiour to the fruit it ſelf: Yet doth the fruit of good Works add much of eſteem and honour from God to ſuch a perſon; and render him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an excellent reward: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Philippians aſſureth them and us, when he ſaith, <hi>I deſire fruit that may abound to your account.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>TO the informing our ſelves aright in the much controverted point of Juſtification, (which whether it be a proper effect of Good works or not, doth certainly bear ſuch a relation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o them as may well claim this place to be treated of) it ſeemeth very expedient, after we have diſtinguiſhed, and illuſtrated it by Sanctification explained, to proceed to diſtinguiſh it likewiſe from Juſtice. For as Righteouſneſs or holineſs, the ground of Sanctification, is to be diſtinguiſhed from Sanctification it ſelf, ſo is Juſtice the ground to be diſtinguiſhed from Juſtification its complement, and perfect on: This being omitted or confuſedly delivered by diverſe, hath been no ſmall cauſe of great obſcurities. For, Righteouſneſs or Juſtice ſeems to be nothing elſe but an exact agreement of a mans actions in general to the true Rule of Acting, and that Rule is the Law or word of God. For he that offends not againſt that, is undoubtedly a Juſt man of himſelf, by his own works, and needs nothing but Juſtice to declare and ackowledg him for ſuch, no mercy, nor favour. As that thing which agrees with the ſquare or Rule is perfect. But notwithſtanding ſuch ſuppoſed perfect conformitie to the Law of God be perfect righteouſneſs, yet is not this to be Juſtified: Neither can any man in Religion be ſaid more to Juſtifie himſelf, than in civil caſes: where it is plainly one thing to be innocent, and to be an accurate, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable obſerver of the Law in all things, and to have ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in his behalf, that ſo indeed he really is: For this is only to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him: though in pleading his own caſe, in clearing and vindicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a man is vulgarly ſaid to Juſtifie himſelf. And no otherwiſe, if we will keep to the ſafe way of proper and ſtrict ſpeaking, is it in Religion. Suppoſing that which never happen'd ſince Chriſt, that a man ſhould have ſo punctually obſerved every ſmall, as well as great precept of Gods Law, that no exception could be taken againſt him, yet is he not hereby Juſtified, though he may be ſaid to be the true Cauſe of his Juſtification, and that he hath merited it. Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to implie unto us ſaying, <hi>For I know</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>nothing by my ſelf yet am I not hereby Juſtified.</hi> For in truth, Juſtification is an act of God only, as Judge, no leſs then author of his own Laws, upon the intuition of due Conformitie to it, or Satisfaction of it.</p>
                     <p>And, as a man may poſſibly be juſt and yet never be Juſtified (taking things abſtractly;) ſo may a man be unjuſt and guilty and yet be juſtified: doth not the word of God, as well as common reaſon and experience, certifie ſo much? <hi>He that Juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the Juſt, even</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 15.</note>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55232:52"/>
                        <hi>they both are abomination unto the Lord.</hi> This then ſurely may be. No man then can be juſtified by himſelf, or any Act, or Acts of him, no not through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But though he cannot thus Judicially and formally Juſtifie himſelf, it is not ſo repugnant to reaſon or Scripture to be ſaid <hi>Materially</hi> and <hi>Cauſally</hi> to act towards his Juſtification. Nay, he cannot come up to the rigour of the Rule, nor excel ſo far in Juſtice and holineſs, as to demand at Gods hands, his abſolving ſentence: yet that he cannot contribute towards it, is not only falſe, but dangerous doctrine leading men into a ſloathfull deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie, and deſpair, ſo that they ſhall do nothing at all, becauſe they cannot do all that is required of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>But to arrive in this doubtful and perplexed way to the right end of this Diſpute, it will be neceſſarie to paſs briefly through all the ſeveral Cauſes of our Juſtification, and ſo much the rather, becauſe divers before have ſo done, and failed in their Divinity, becauſe of a miſtake in Logick, in miſcalling Cauſes. And firſt we muſt know otherwiſe then ſome have taught, That the Material Cauſe of our Juſtification is not the graces in us, nor the pardon without us; nor remiſſion of ſins, nor obedience of Chriſt, nor of our ſelves; but the perſon juſtified is the ſubject of Juſtification. For who with good ſenſe can ſay, <hi>Our ſins are juſtified,</hi> our good works are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified?<note place="margin">Acts. 13. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</note> True it is St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>by him (Chriſt) all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be Juſtified by the Law of Moſes:</hi> Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby, that we are Juſtified from our ſins: but not that our ſins are Juſtified. And ſo where St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks ſo often (of which hereafter) that we are Juſtified by Works, he intendeth not to ſay our Works are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For tis the perſon, not the qualities of him, that is Juſtified. And if any ſpeak otherwiſe, they muſt be helpt out by recurring to Figurative not proper ſpeaking. In ſuch caſes as theſe, if ever we would judge aright, we muſt hold as preciſely as can be to propriety of ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>About the Final cauſe of our Juſtification, I find nothing ſingular, but in common with all the Acts of God towards man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the Actions of Man towards God, <hi>viz, The glory of God.</hi> Neither is there any difference of parties herein.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the Formal Cauſe of our Juſtification before God, ſome diſcord is found; yea concerning a <hi>Formal Cauſe,</hi> in General, what it is; and wherein it conſiſteth; which is very neceſſarie to be underſtood to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the true notion of being Formally Juſtified. A Formal Cauſe then is that whereby a thing is, what it is; ſubſiſts in it ſelf, and is diſtinguiſhed from other things; being always eſſential and intrinſecal to the thing, ſo by it conſtituted, that it cannot be ſo much as conceived without it, and cannot poſſibly but be, with it. This, whether artificial or not, I weigh not much; but is a true deſcription of that Cauſe. For inſtance ſake, A man is a man properly by his ſoul, and not by his body, his ſoul being his Inward form; and as it is impoſſible that he ſhould be ſo without it, ſo is it impoſſible but that he ſhould be ſo, with it; whatever outward viſible defects or imperfections may appear otherwiſe. So in the preſent cauſe, it muſt neceſſarily be, that the <hi>Formal Cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification be intrinſecal to the Juſtified perſon; and that not being, that he ſhould not be juſtified: Contrary to what ſome have affirmed upon this occaſion; who from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an Eclipſe, would ſhow that the formal Cauſe is not alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to that which it formeth. For, ſay they (as it ſhould ſeem by the autority of <hi>Zabarel</hi>) In an Eclipſe of the Sun, the Moon interpoſing, is the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55232:53"/>
formal Cauſe of the Darkneſs of the Earth, and yet it is not intrinſecal to it, but ſeparate. But the miſtake is plain; that the Moon being not the cauſe of the earth it ſelf, but of the darkneſs of the earth only, it is not the Formal Cauſe of that, and ſo may be extrinſecal to it, and intrinſecal to the darkneſs, as the formal cauſe: but whether this be ſo or not, we are here only to ſhow that no cauſe formal can be external to the thing of which it is the form; and by conſequence, that nothing without us can be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of our Juſtification, or that whereby we are denominated Juſt before God: So that neither Chriſt, nor his merits do render us ſo Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore, they who to magnifie the miſtery of our Juſtification do object to themſelves, How a man can be Juſt, by the juſtice of another, and how righteous by another perſons righteouſneſs, any more than a man can hear with another mans ears, or ſee with another mans eyes, do tie ſuch a knot as they can by no means looſe. For in plain truth, neither the one nor the other can formally be. But they may ſay, As it is Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs indeed and reſts only in him, ſo we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified formally by it but as it is made ours eſpecially by Faith, and is applied unto us, ſo we may be formally Juſtified by it. To which I ſay, that if that individual formal Righteouſneſs which is in Chriſt were by any means ſo transferred formally unto us and infuſed into us, that we ſhould in like manner poſſeſs it, as did Chriſt; then indeed the argument would hold ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, that by ſuch application we were Juſtified formally by Chriſts righteouſneſs: but no ſuch thing will be granted, neither is any ſuch thing needfull.

For neither is that formal righteouſneſs in us, which is inherent Righteouſneſs, the formal Cauſe of our Juſtification. But our Juſtification formal, is an Act of God terminating in Man, whereby he is abſolved from all guilt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Juſt, and accepted to Grace and favour with God. When God hath actually paſſed this divine, free and gracious ſentence upon a ſinner, then, and not before, is he formally Juſtified.

                     <p>IT remains therefore now that we proceed to the means, cauſes and motives, inducing God Almighty thus to Juſtifie Man a ſinner; whom he might rather condemn for his unrighteouſneſs. And theſe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and divers in kind, as they are, may all be reduced unto the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſes ſo often miſtaken for the formal. And truly, to proceed herein regularly and clearly, we muſt begin with the Cauſe of all Cauſes, God himſelf. For though Chriſt be the Cauſe of all Cauſes viſible, and in the actual adminiſtration and execution; yet he is not the firſt, but ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate<note place="margin">

                        </note> Cauſe of Mans reconciliation to God, his Juſtification and Salvation. For as holy <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> divinely and ſublimely enquiring into the reaſon that might incline God to reſtore Man being fallen, and loſt by his Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy from God, unto a ſtate of bliſs again; to admit of any terms of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him; determines it, it is nothing but the divine Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of God, his free, undeſerved, unſcrutable love towards man, ſpringing, (as it were,) from his own breaſt, beginning within himſelf, and of himſelf abſolutely, irreſpectively to any outward motives, but to ſhow as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He would have mercie on whom he would have mercie, and he</hi>

For not ſo much as any conſideration of Chriſt could diſpoſe him to decree ſo favourably on the behalf of man: but firſt, this decree paſſed, and then followed the determination of the means, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient thereunto: which was, to ſend his ſon, to give him to be Incarnate and to be the great and powerful Mediator between God and Man; mighty to ſave. Chriſt then was that which in general moved God Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaly to the Juſtification of Man, after he had conceived of himſelf a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reconcile man to himſelf; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly aſſerteth in his ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Corinthians, <hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>

                        <hi>who of God is made unto us wiſdom and righteouſneſs, Sanctification and redemption.</hi> Therefore it is, that ſo often in Scripture Chriſt is called a<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 20. Heb. 8. 6. 1 Tim. 2. 5. Heb. 9. 15. Heb. 12. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and man; for the bringing to paſs, and cauſing to take effect, the General decree of God for the redemption of Mankind. For through Chriſt we were by God predeſtinated, as is taught us by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Epheſians, <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Where<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5.</note> we ſee plainly, that Chriſt was not the Cauſe that we were predeſtinated in Chriſt, but the Good pleaſure of his Abſolute will. Again, we were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55232:54"/>
called in Chriſt, as St. <hi>Jude</hi> implieth, ſaying, <hi>To them that are ſanctified</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jud. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, and called.</hi> And as we are called and ſanctified, ſo certainly are we juſtified freely by Chriſt. And there is nothing more requiſite for us to be fully juſtified in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, then to be made partakers of Chriſt: and, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To be found in Chriſt, not having our own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> [<hi>whether of Nature or Moſes] but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> From whence, and ſeveral other texts of Holy Scripture teſtifying the abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt to the Juſtifying and ſaving of us, it appeareth that nothing can be more contrary to the Eternal purpoſe of ſaving man through Chriſt, yea nothing indeed more tidiculous, then to but imagine that there can be any Act in man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct from Chriſt, and not receiving all its worth and vertue from Chriſt, which can avail any thing towards the ſalvation or Juſtification of him: Or that a man being grafted into Chriſt, and partaking of his graces and merits, can fail of being accepted of God unto Juſtification, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Romans, <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23, 24, 25.</note> 
                        <hi>of the glory of God: Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now there are three things in General which truly denominate us to be in Chriſt, and partakers of him: To be partakers of the benefit of his Paſſion ſatisfying for us: To be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his ſpirit, and graces thereof renewing and ſanctifying us: and thirdly, to be partakers of his Interceſſion before God on our behalf. For as the Scripture tells us, <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi> And this<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> his interceſſion, an Act of his Sacerdotal office, is it whereby Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly meriteth for us. For the Paſſion of Chriſt doth ſufficiently diſcharge us of our former Obligations and obnoxiouſneſs to the Law of God, and the puniſhments therein denounced againſt the contemners and violaters thereof; and ſo may be ſaid, having fully ſatisfied all the Law juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of us, to have merited pardon and remiſſion of what is paſſed, doth not thereupon entitle us to any graces or bleſſings from God, but yet putteth us into a capacity of them; but the actual collation of them is rather owing unto the unceſſant mediation of him before God in behalf of us. And this the Scripture intends, when it ſaith, <hi>We have a great high Prieſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the ſon of God.</hi> And thus we have made a ſecond ſtep towards the clearing our Juſtification in its Efficient Cauſes, <hi>viz,</hi> That it is wholly effected by Chriſt made righteouſneſs ſanctification and Redemption unto us.</p>
                     <p>But a third thing and that of no mean neceſſity and difficulty both, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, how we come to be ſo entirely partakers of Chriſt, how Chriſt ſo becomes ours as that God ſhould upon the intuition hereof freely Juſtifie us? For as St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath obſerved of the giving of the Holy ſpirit of God to thoſe that ask aright (whereas none can ask aright but by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit,) herein is a great myſterie that a man can be ſaid to be capable of the Spirit before he hath the Spirit: In like manner, can no man be ſaid to be capable of Chriſt and his Benefits, before he be in ſome manner actually in Chriſt. For if all our works are Sanctified by Gods Spirit, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, only as they are done in Chriſt; how can any ſuch Acts lead us unto Chriſt, or make us capable of him, ſeeing it is one of the greateſt perfections and excellencie of good Works, or Faith (for unleſs it, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55232:54"/>
we be in Chriſt, it cannot be a ſaving Faith. i. e. leading us to Salvation) to make us effectual partakers of, and one with him?</p>
                     <p>Theſe difficulties conſtrain us to diſtinguiſh both Faith and being in Chriſt into (I cannot ſay properly, two kinds as) two eminent Periods, and Degrees of Faith, and being in Chriſt. The one is initial, and preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as a foundation; which is not a diſtinct building from the houſe finiſhed and furniſhed, but a part of it; and material Cauſe thereof. The other is conſummate and formed: yet not ſo, but addition of perfection, though not of Parts, may be made; all mens Faith being capable of farther degrees in this life. And from hence that myſtical ſenſe of our Saviours words in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, may both give, and receive illuſtration. For in the ſixth of <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt hath theſe words, <hi>No man can come unto me except the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And in the fourteenth of <hi>John</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>me.</hi> Teaching us, That notwithſtanding, God is the Firſt cauſe to bring us to be in Chriſt, and that by his Predeſtination before time, and his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Electing us in time, to the knowledge and Faith in Chriſt, yet he is not reconciled unto us; he doth not pardon us, nor juſtify us, before Chriſt brings us unto him: and offers us to him as a new l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mp, and as capable of his grace and favour, which obtained, we are then truly juſtified by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And as there are two diſtinct acts of God, the one of his good Providence in bringing us to the Covenant made with mankind in Chriſt; and the other of his ſpecial Grace in accepting us through Chriſt, being in the Covenant; So are there two principal Periods (as I ſaid) of being in Chriſt: and the Firſt is when we are taken within the Covenant of the Goſpel of Grace, by baptiſm; whereby we are made members of Chriſts myſtical Body and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritours of the Kingdom of Heaven. Not that immediately and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, All baptized perſons are ſure to go to heaven, but all baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are thereby put into a capacity and Right to heaven. To this St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> to the Galatians gives us his fair ſuffrage, ſaying, For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt have put on Chriſt. And the ſame is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this his ſalutation: <hi>Salute Andronicus and Junias my kinſmen and my</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>fellow Priſoners, who are of note among the Apoſtles, who alſo were in Chriſt, before me.</hi> Where doubtleſs theſe perſons are ſaid to be in Chriſt, before St. <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe they were baptized, and made profeſſion of Chriſt, before St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And ſo when he ſpeaks of <hi>the Churches of Judea which are in Chriſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 22.</note> he meaneth no more than ſuch who were become of Jews, Chriſtians in Judea; not intending that every one who ſo profeſſed Chriſt ſhould be infallibly Juſtified and ſaved by Chriſt, as they ſhall who are arrived to the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of being in Chriſt; of which the Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians.; <hi>Whom</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>we preach, warning every man, and teaching every</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>man in all wiſdome, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what is, or wherein this perfection in Chriſt doth conſiſt, is I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe paſt any mans apprehenſion or Judgement preciſely to determine; that is, what degree of holineſs in Chriſt, God will accept to our Juſtification: but in general theſe two States of a Chriſtian are plainly deſeribed thus by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt Jeſus, he is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> Where being <hi>a new Creature,</hi> and being in Chriſt, are diſtinguiſhed as Cauſe and Effect: our being in Chriſt Jeſus being the reaſon and cauſe of becoming New creatures. So that we may well obſerve in this caſe a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Converſion requiſite to make a man truly in Chriſt. A converſion to Chriſt, by renouncing falſe Religions, and falſe opinions of a Deity, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55232:55"/>
aſſenting to, and embracing the doctrine according to Godlineſs. This eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man doth, who takes on him the name, profeſſion, and mitiating Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Chriſtian: of this is to be underſtood what is ſpoken of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Gentiles. And this converſion is rather (to ſpeak properly)<note place="margin">Acts 15. 3.</note> a converſion to the truth of Godlineſs, than to true Godlineſs; Or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the Truth of Faith, rather then to the life of Faith: of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galatians, <hi>The life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi> The ſumm then of all this, is this, That to be in Chriſt effectually, to our Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſo to be converted unto him as to believe the Faith of Chriſt and to Live the life of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This being cleared, nearer acceſs is made unto the ſolution of the prime Doubt; which is, What is that which ſo farr and fully enſtateth us in Chriſt, that thereupon God doth freely juſtifie us? For it is now ſuppoſed and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that our ſo being in Chriſt making us partakers of the merits, mediation, and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, doth immediately and abſolutely qualifie to Juſtification: and ſecondarily, that which brings us into Chriſt may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough be ſaid to be it whereby we are Juſtified. And here comes in the grand diſpute about the vertue of Faith, Whether that only, and wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth this? For in what ſenſe Faith may be ſaid to bring us unto Chriſt, or thus to lay hold (as they ſay) of Chriſt, in the ſame may it be truly affirmed that, next under God and Chriſt, we are Juſtified by it.</p>
                     <p>This I know not how it can be effected better, then by the help of a moſt obvious and neceſſary, but moſt neglected diſtinction of the uſe and notion of Faith in holy Scripture; omitting that threefold Faith above-mentioned, and ſeveral others impertinently invented and ill imployed in this caſe. For Faith is taken in Scripture either <hi>Complexly</hi> and Generally for the whole Body of Chriſtian divinity, and Graces contained in the New teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Or it is taken <hi>Simply,</hi> and diſtinctly, for a ſpecial Grace ſeparate (I mean in nature not in Operation) from Hope and Charity, which together conſtitute the three Theological Graces. Inſtances of the former have been given already in the twelfth Chapter, and need not here be repeated in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For let any man of common equity and underſtanding, weigh the ſubject and end of all St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to the Romans, to the Coloſſians, to the Galatians, to the Hebrews eſpecially (not excluding the other,) where he moſt expreſly and zealouſly urges Faith againſt works, and he ſhall ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that his intention and drift is, not abſolutely to oppoſe works of Faith to the doctrine or Grace of Faith, but the works of the Law; which infirmer Chriſtians, newly entred into the Faith of Chriſt, had ſo venerable an opinion of, that they imagined Chriſt could profit nothing without the works either Ceremonial or Moral of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For whereas they for inſtance, depended abſolutely on Circumciſion, for their Juſtification, and thought that without ſo ſacred and ſolemn a Rite, they could not be profited by Chriſt himſelf; St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the other ſide, reſolutely and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determineth thus, <hi>Behold I Paul ſay unto, you that if you be circumciſed</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2. v. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> And preſently after, <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect unto you, whoſoever of you are Juſtified by the Law: ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> Can any thing be more manifeſt then here it is, that Grace is oppoſed to the Law? And that to truſt in that, is to fall from Chriſt? And when it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>We through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by Faith;</hi> is it not<note place="margin">v. 5.</note> as plain as need be, that Faith is here taken for that doctrine (and not Act) of Faith, whereby men are inſtructed in Chriſt, believe in Chriſt, adhere
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55232:55"/>
to him, relinquiſhing the imperfect and antiquated doctrine of the Law, and its practiſes; which by St. <hi>Paul</hi> are all called <hi>Fleſh</hi> in oppoſition to the ſpiritual worſhip of the Goſpel: as to the Philippians, <hi>For we are the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh. Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4.

Even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all</hi>
                        <note place="margin">22. 20. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>and upon all that believe.</hi> And verſe the twentieth, <hi>By the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> And verſe the twenty ſeventh, the Anti the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, or oppoſition doth moſt evidently declare the Apoſtles intention. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded, By what Law? Of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> The Law of Works then is the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Law of Faith is the Law of Chriſt. And to be <hi>Juſtified by Faith in Jeſus,</hi> of which immediately before, is to be underſtood of the whole Covenant of Grace or Faith, which is made to us in Chriſt Jeſus, and revealed in the Goſpel as contradiſtinct to that Covenant of Works given by <hi>Moſes:</hi> and not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecial Grace or Act of Faith, as Faith is ſometimes diſtinguiſhed from other Evangelical Graces.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid that the works of the Law are excluded expreſly, and therefore no competition is to be made between them and Faith, in the caſe of our Juſtification. To which my anſwer is, That though I grant, that not only the works of the Law, though moral, do not Juſtifie, but not the works of Faith, of themſelves; yet I may confidently ſay, None of theſe places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alleadged by the Exalters of Faith, and Depreſſors of Good works, to null the merits of works done even in Faith of Chriſt, do, according to the literal meaning, really perform ſo much: yet I rather chooſe to affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the works excluded by St. <hi>Paul</hi> are not works of the Law moral, ſo much as Moſaical. For the morality of the Old Law was not properly of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the Ceremonial only, and conſequently the Law from theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its denomination of <hi>Moſaical,</hi> when works of the Law are mentioned in the New Teſtament, we are to underſtand <hi>Moſaical Works,</hi> rather than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: but not at all works of Faith.

                     <p>But it is uſually replied, No, God forbid we ſhould divide Faith from good Works. Where there is true juſtifying Faith, there will be, there muſt be good works: and that for ſeveral other reaſons, but not for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This is moſt true, whereever there is a Juſtifying Faith there will be, good Works, but what do they there in order to Juſtification? Juſt as much as the fair gay train of a Peacock to the bird that draws it after it, make a fine ſhow, and that is all that we know of. But the difficulty is yet very ſtrong behind: And that is, ſeeing it is granted that ſome, Faith in Chriſt is Juſtifying, and ſome is not Juſtifying; whence comes this about? Is it not becauſe one is a lively and operative Faith, and the other is drie and unactive and unfruitful? So that Faith which is ſaid to Juſtifie, is it ſelf firſt Juſtified by its works. For though, as hath been ſaid, Faith doth abſolutely produce good Works, and not good Works Faith: yet good Works are they in which its goodneſs conſiſts next unto its object, Chriſt, and conſequently render it Juſtifying actually.</p>

                        <p> Of the Special Notion of Faith; and the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it hath on our Juſtification. Of Faith So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, and Onely. Of a Particular and General Faith. Particular Faith no more an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Juſtification by Chriſt, than other co-ordinate Graces. How ſome Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirm that Faith without Works Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ALL this while we have treated of the complex notion of Faith; or at leaſt, as it is that firſt general Grace whereby we are inſerted into Chriſt, and juſtified by it together with its bleſſed retinue of ſubordinate Evangelical Graces, which are reduced to theſe three, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> where Faith ſtandeth by its ſelf, and is a peculiar Grace of it ſelf, and hath in this acceptation a more then common prerogative attributed unto it in order to our Juſtification, or the bringing us to Chriſt, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſt. For that is it whereby we are only properly juſtified; and all Graces ſerve for no other end here, than to <hi>adopt</hi> us for the benefit of Juſtification through Chriſt, and for Chriſt's ſake alone. So that no man can as yet complain, That though I derogate ſomewhat from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and value of Faith in reference to our Juſtification, as it is explained by moderner Divines (ſome I mean;) I do not in the leaſt detract from the ſufficiencies, freeneſs, and abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt's Merits and Grace towards us. Yea, I eſtabliſh it; nay, I augment and commend more the Free Grace of God, then do they who have choſe another way to expreſs it. For all this while I do not compare Works with Chriſt, nor Hope, nor Charity, nor Obedience, with Chriſt; (as is plain) but I compare now one Grace with another; and Faith ſimply conſidered, with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith. For, Faith taken as in general for the embracing of the<note place="margin">Fundamentum ergo eſi juſtitiae Fides. <hi>Ambr. Offic.

                        </note> whole <hi>Body</hi> of the Goſpel, hath this undoubted prerogative to be the Grace of all Graces, the Mother of all, the Fountain from which all flow; and, as the Fathers generally do juſtifie, becauſe it is the foundation of all acceſs to Chriſt. Which aſſertion of theirs, however later Wits have ſlighted and contemned, as not giving Faith its due, in order to our Juſtification, doth in my opinion, with much greater perſpicuity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ſoundneſs, expreſs its proper office, then thoſe newly inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſeveral diſtinctions and ſub-diſtinctions confunding, rather than ſetling the judgment of a good Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, They aſcribe this virtue of Juſtifying to a ſpecial Faith: Then they ſay, this Faith doth not juſtifie as a Work, or Act, but Grace.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55232:57"/>
Then they proceed to affirm, That not as a principal cauſe, but only as an inſtrument created by God in the heart to that end. And yet farther, Not as an Inſtrument active and operative; but as an Inſtrument rather receptive and paſſive, as appears by the example given of an Hand, which is no true cauſe of an Alms given; but yet it properly receives it. But firſt, What a diſorder muſt theſe multiplyed niceties needs breed in the minds of the ſimpler ſort, who are not able to comprehend them; and ſo are brought into great troubles of conſcience, whether their Faith be directed to Chriſt under the true relation it ought to bear? How much more clear and eaſie is that Doctrine that teaches, Firſt; That neither our Faith nor Works proceeding from thence, can avail any thing, without Chriſt, and that all their ſufficiencie is of Chriſt. And next, That this Faith and good Works do but qualifie us, according to the Free Covenant of Grace, for Chriſt. Secondly, If it be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in truth it is, That Faith is any more an Inſtrument, whether active or paſſive; or a Hand, as it is called, to lay hold (eſpecially in another kind) of Chriſt, than Hope or Charity; I do not find how they can prove it. For I may, and do yield a greater <hi>degree</hi> of vertue in Faith ſpecial, well founded on God, than in other Graces diſtinct from it; but I do not yield that this is the Faith properly by them contended for: For, It is a mixt compound Grace, conſiſting of Hope and Love, which they call [<hi>Fiducia</hi>] Confidence, and reſting upon God. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a ſpecial Grace as conſidered in ſubordination to the general Grace, whereby we aſſent and ſubmit to the Goſpel of Chriſt: but it is not ſpecial, as diſtinct from other co-ordinate Graces with it.<note place="margin">Calvin. Inſt. Petrus Mart. Lo. Com. claſs. 3. cap. 4. num. 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what manner of Faith (ſay they) do we ſuppoſe that, which goes ſo ill attended alone? Firſt, I ſuppoſe there is ſuch a Grace diſtinct from others, and that which was ſet up againſt others to juſtifie, and now croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it all others to make it juſtifying, they affirm what at firſt they were ſo much denyed; namely, That juſtifying Faith is not ſo much a ſingle, or ſingular Chriſtian Grace, as a confluence of many Evangelical Graces together; which render a man capable of being juſtified; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant of Free Grace, before God, though never worthy. To which we readily aſſent. Again, If, as they ſay, Faith [<hi>Sola, non So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>] Only,</hi> not <hi>Alone</hi> juſtifies, it will be no leſs difficult for them to give either good autority or reaſon, why the ſame may not be aſcribed to Love, or Charity, or to Hope; and when the inſufficiencie of either of theſe be declared, to that effect; it may not as reaſonably now, as before he replyed, and ſaid, Charity only doth juſtifie, but not alone, becauſe Faith and Hope muſt be conjoyned with it. There is little judgment or ſincerity in ſuch manner of diſputings as theſe.</p>
                     <p>But here, to prevent ſuſpition of miſ-reporting the opinions of ſuch as contend for a modern notion of juſtification by Faith, which the Holy Fathers were ignorant of, I find my ſelf conſtrained to ſet down the ſtate and reaſon of the Queſtion, as that learned man, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath explain'd,<note place="margin">Perkins on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. v. 10. &amp;c</note> and defended Juſtification by Faith. In his <hi>Reformed Catholique, Point the fourth:</hi> And in his Comment on the <hi>Galatians</hi> he moves this neceſſary Querie, as moſt material to the clearing of the Controverſie; <hi>What is that very thing that cauſeth a man to ſtand righteous before God; and to be accepted to Life everlaſting.</hi> To this in both places he anſwers, altogether to the ſame ſenſe and purpoſe, and with very little alteration of words; ſaying, <hi>The Obedience, or Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and it ſtands in two things,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55232:57"/>
his Paſſion in Life and Death, and his Fulfilling the Law joyned therewith:</hi> which he calls the Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution there is no difference between us; no exception juſtly to be taken.<note place="margin">Perkins Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. pag. 570</note> Now ſayes he afterward (<hi>pag. 570. Reform. Cath.) All, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, agree that a ſinner is juſtified by Faith: This agreement</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is only in word.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>The Papiſt ſaying, we are juſtified by Faith, underſtands a General or Catholick Faith, whereby a man believeth the Articles of Religion to be true. But we hold, That the Faith which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth is a Particular Faith, whereby we apply to our ſelves the Promiſes of Righteouſneſs, and Life everlaſting, by Chriſt.</hi> But if we ſay, That even the General Faith (not taken for the Object or Articles of Faith, but Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit exerciſed) performeth this ſufficiently, though not immediately (as in truth we do) by the influence it hath upon inferiour and ſubordinate Graces, whereof a Particular is but one; then in vain is all laid upon the Particular Faith. And that place by him alledged out of <hi>Galatians</hi> 2. 20. makes more againſt what he would prove by it, than for it: viz. <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> For it is directly denyed, That hereby is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſuch a Particular Faith as is before mentioned by us: The words of the Apoſtle before, and the main deſign of his Epiſtle declaring that he underſtood no other Faith in Chriſt here, than that General whereby he relinquiſhed the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with all its imperfect umbrages, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf, by Faith, to Chriſt; and liv'd now according to Chriſt, and not to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Neither doth that which follows prove the ſpecialty of this St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Faith, as he conceives: viz. <hi>Who hath loved me, and given himſelf for me,</hi> particularly. For this is apparently a Predicate of Chriſt, and not of the Faith there ſpoken of: It is a deſcription of Chriſt, and not of the Faith in Chriſt; which if it were, would make but little to the purpoſe. For who knows not that a General Faith comprehends a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Faith, and the Faith whereby we believe and receive the Goſpel, diſpoſes us to believe that Chriſt died for us, which is one part of that Faith: And the Faith that believes that Chriſt dyed for all, doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily lead us to believe that Chriſt dyed for me particularly. Therefore, ſtill it remaineth unreſolved, what ſingular and ſignal vertue there is in the Particular Grace of Faith, which other Evangelical Graces depending upon the General Faith, as well as doth this Particular Faith, may not be capable of in order to our Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Hear we then, to underſtand this better, what the ſame learned Author ſayes in the entrance to that Treatiſe of the <hi>Reformed Catholick. A man is juſtified by Faith alone, becauſe Faith is that alone inſtrument, created in the heart by the Holy Ghoſt, whereby the ſinner layeth hold on Chriſt his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and applyeth the ſame unto himſelf: There is neither Hope, nor Love, nor any other Grace of God within man, that doth this, but Faith alone.</hi> Thus he. Where ſeveral things are taken for granted, not to be granted. Firſt, That Faith is any more created in the heart of man, than any other Grace, there expreſſed or implyed. Secondly, That it is an Inſtrument Active, laying hold of Chriſt, in a ſpecial different manner from other Graces. For in truth, we are not ſo much juſtified or made partakers of Chriſt, by our laying hold of him; as by his laying hold of us. Thirdly, That in what ſenſe Faith may be ſaid to lay hold on Chriſt, in the ſame, the other Graces may not likewiſe be ſaid ſo to do; becauſe all Graces (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly) which are indeed operative (as is ſaid) towards our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, are but Paſſive in order to our Juſtification, which is an act of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55232:58"/>
God only, declaring, and holding us Juſt in Chriſt Jeſus. So that the old Querie here returns upon us again, Which of all theſe Graces prevail moſt to the inſerting us into Chriſt: which I grant to be the General Faith, as a foundation and firſt mover of all Graces. And as for the particular Faith compared with its fellow Graces, it may be allowed <hi>a greater vertue,</hi> but not of <hi>another kind,</hi> in reference to our union with Chriſt. For, when an humble and deſponding Chriſtian conſidering his own unworthineſs, and the unſufficiency of his repentance it ſelf, and graces to incline God to mercy, ſo far as for their ſakes to accept him in Chriſt for juſt and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; he, as the laſt refuge he hath, quitteth all worth and capacities in himſelf, and fleeth with a ſtrong confidence (which in this caſe is called Faith) unto the free and abſolute Grace of God revealed in Chriſt Jeſus unto us: upon which God beholding the whole glory of the Abſolution of ſuch a ſinner, to redound to his Grace, is pleaſed to receive ſuch a perſon to mercy, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Thou ſhalt keep him in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>

And that from hence, or the like Texts, not a different vertue in nature or kind, though peradventure more effectual and prevalent, is aſcribed to it above other Graces, in order to our Juſtification. All which is no leſs true of our Sanctification than our Juſtification. For we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much ſanctified by Faith alone, as we are juſtified by Faith alone, or only: as appeareth from the Scripture, which ſaith, That <hi>our hearts are</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 15. 3. Acts 15. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>purified by Faith.</hi> So that in this much diſputed Queſtion, I know no readier way of ſatisfying the fearful and dubious mind, than by taking a due eſtimate of the power of a General or Particular Faith in reference to<note place="margin">Fides nos à peccatis omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus purgat, mentes noſtras illuminat, Deo concliat. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper. ubi ſupr.</hi>
                        </note> our Sanctification, and judging alike of our Juſtification thereby. For we are ſanctified as freely by Grace, as we are juſtified, and as much by Faith too: as <hi>Proſper</hi> before cited, ſaith.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, laſtly, in anſwer to divers places of the Ancients which are produced to confirm the modern ſenſe of Juſtification by Faith alone, I anſwer in a word. That it is true, their words ſeem to atteſt ſo much, but their meaning was plainly no more than this; That Faith many times doth juſtifie without Works, that is, any outward manifeſtation of their Faith, by ſuch fruits: but never without inward acts of Repentance and Charity diſtinct from this ſpecial Faith: nor without ſuch a devotion to good Works, which wants nothing but opportunity to exert them; which is by an extraordinary Clemencie and Grace of God, accepted for the thing it ſelf. This appears by the example by them given, to manifeſt their meaning, of the Thief on the Croſs; who was ſo juſtified and ſaved by Faith alone, without good Works anſwerable thereunto, becauſe his ſudden faith was prevented by ſudden death. Nevertheleſs, That his Faith was ſo much alone as to exclude Repentance, and ſuch Graces as were competible to one in his condition from a proportionable concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that effect, is no where ſaid, nor intended by any of the Fathers, whoſe judgment is of account in the Church of God.</p>

ſeen, there reſteth and conſiſteth withall a diffidence and doubting, as we have ſhewed: The reconciliation of this ſeeming oppoſition doth lead us to a neceſſary diſtinction tending to the reſolving of the principal Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and it is between the <hi>State</hi> of Juſtification, and the <hi>Act</hi> of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And again, as to Aſſurance here ſpoken of, It is one thing to be aſſured of our Juſtification, and another of our Salvation, as ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appear. Firſt then, I hold it ſufficiently demonſtrable out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That a man may, and every good Chriſtian ought to be aſſured that he is in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of being juſtified and ſaved likewiſe. This we teach well in our Church Catechiſe in anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Doeſt not thou think that thou art bound to believe, as they have promiſed for thee?</hi> thus. <hi>Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and by Gods help ſo I will: and I heartily thank our heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this</hi> State <hi>of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Every Chriſtian that in Baptiſm hath put on Chriſt, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Covenant of Grace with God, is bound to believe aſſuredly, that thereby he is in a ſtate of Salvation and Juſtification. For thereby, God hath eſpecially elected him to ſalvation: of which Election the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures chiefly, if not only, ſpeak; which are drawn to ſignife the Eternal Decree of God, chooſing not only men eſtranged from God to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, but ſuch as are firſt within the Covenant, to an infallible Juſtification and Salvation. This I ſay is rarely, if at all intended by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe many Texts of Scripture alledged to prove the ſame, they meaning no more then Gods Election to the ſtate of Grace; that is, the Faith and Profeſſion of the Goſpel. Whence it is that the perſons ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and converted to Chriſt, are by St. Paul called <hi>the Election:</hi> as <hi>Rom. 9. 11. For the children being not yet born, neither having done good</hi>

                     <p>Now of this ſort of Aſſurance I make no doubt but the word of God is more genuinely interpreted and applyed, than of that perſonal aſſurance peculiar to ſome, who frame another notion of being elected; which is of being ſignally choſen out of the former Elect to an infallible aſſurance of their Juſtification and Salvation: which though I willingly grant o be

true; <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath his peculiar ones amongſt Chriſtians too, as Chriſtians amongſt Heathen; yet I find little or nothing ſpoken of under the ſaid Appellations of Elect, Elected, Election, in Scripture, but of the firſt ſenſe generally. My appeal ſhall be to the indifferent judge, by laying the teſtimonies before him, which are principally theſe, many coming nothing near the point. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> That <hi>he did not doubt of the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>in ſaith, giving glory to God. And being fully perſwaded that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform.</hi> How far this is beſide the matter every ſober man will eaſily ſee, that ſhall conſider ſeriouſly; That theſe Promiſes were made directly and expreſly to <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon, and not in common with other perſons. And can any man be ſo unadviſed as to conclude, That becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> having ſuch a particular and perſonal Promiſe made to him by God, and indeed abſolute and inconditionate, that he ſhould have a Son by <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, which he believed, and without ſtaggering was aſſured of; therefore they, who have no ſuch perſonal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances given of God, but only general, and alwayes conditional, of their Juſtification and Life Everlaſting, can be in like manner aſſured of the ſame: or ought to believe that they ſhall be ſaved, as much as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did, that God would ſend him a Son, as he promiſed?

                     <p>It is ſaid, that Faith is oppoſite to doubting: For, Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Matth. 14. 31. O thou of little Faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> This is very true: and therefore we ſay, It is no article or object of our Faith, to believe that we ſhall be infallibly ſaved: but it is rather an object of our Fear, and more properly of our Hope. For though it be ſaid in the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>I believe the remiſſion or forgiveneſs of ſgins;</hi> it is not meant, that any man ſhould thereby ſtand obliged to believe, as an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, the actual forgiveneſs of his own ſins: but that his own ſins and all other Chriſtian peoples are remiſſible: and that in the Catholick Church, there is forgiveneſs to all that repent and believe. And this is no more then that General Aſſurance; that by being baptized we are in a ſtate of Salvation, as is above-ſaid.</p>
                     <p>To multiply many Texts to infer this from Gods faithfulneſs, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth: and from his gifts being without repentance, and ſuch like, are not worth their time that uſe them; nor would it be worth mine to examine them, any farther then to ſay, That they are a great deal too large, to have any particular relation to a mans perſonal ſtate: As if God muſt needs change, if a man falls from his ſtedfaſt purpoſe. Or God, when he in his own counſel determines to ſave any man infallibly, muſt inſeparably annex thereunto this Evidence of his will to the Party, any more then it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all men, who leave others their Eſtates, ſhould tell them ſo much; and require at their hands that they make no queſtion of the ſame, under the penalty of forfeiting all.</p>

But two exceptions are made againſt this way; the one, That the diſpute is only about the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpenſations, common to all true believers. The other, That theſe places alledged prove no more than the common Juſtification of believers, and their Adoption: As for inſtance, <hi>John 1. 12. As many as received him,</hi>

The whole Antecedent I grant; <hi>viz.</hi> That every man believeth Chriſt when he receiveth him; and that Chriſt is received by Faith: And that every man is bound to apply Chriſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and his Promiſes to himſelf. But the conſequence here made, follows not from hence: For by the former, a man believes aſſuredly that the Promiſes of Grace made through Chriſt to the Church, do particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to him: he hath a right to them, being called to the Covenant:<note place="margin">Neither do we promiſe any other ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by only Faith, but to thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in their calling, and be fruitful of good Works.

                        <hi>Ye have not received again the ſpirit of bondage to fear, but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> What is more plain than that his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, to diſtinguiſh the general ſtate of the Church of the Jews from the Church of the Gentiles: and the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as I may ſo ſay) which tender'd to bondage, from the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is that free Spirit: For as it is elſewhere ſaid, <hi>If the Son make you free, then ſhall you be free indeed.</hi> And from hence no more can be concluded to any ſingle perſon than to the whole Church of God, in which there are many reprobates, as all agree. Neither is the matter helped out any whit by what follows; <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Sons of God.</hi> I preſume, few will be ſo ſevere and ignorant as to deny the large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in Scripture of the <hi>Children of God,</hi> and <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and <hi>Saints, viz.</hi> That generally they ſignifie no more than thoſe who were elected out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the Faith and Profeſſion of Chriſt, and to the means of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only denominatively, and of <hi>Right,</hi> but really, and effectually in <hi>Fact,</hi> the heirs of Eternal Salvation. To be then <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> here with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſignifies no more than by Faith to be the <hi>peculiar people</hi> and favorites of God, above all ſuch as were not thus brought home to Chriſts Fold. Now that ſuch ſingular Grace and Priviledges belonged to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves from the teſtimony of the Spirit, namely; That the Chriſtian Religion is only the true Religion, thus. <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs with our Spirit:</hi> Our own Judgment, our Conſciences doth ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly aſſure us that we are the Children of God: but this is not all: this proves nothing to another to the convincing of him that we are the true Servants and Children of God; but <hi>the Spirit of God bearing witneſs with our Spirit,</hi> doth. And the Spirit of God beareth witneſs with us ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55232:60"/>
when it declareth openly by miracles, ſigns, and wonders wrought before the eyes of our Adverſaries, that what we preach and believe is the truth: Which is the ſame with what St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> ſaying: <hi>And my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power: That your faith might ſtand not in the wiſdom of man, but in the power of God.</hi> In which words he plainly ſheweth the ground of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> faith, not to be taken from any fair or plauſible Rhetorick, or form of words, whereby men are led oftentimes to believe againſt reaſon; but on the more ſolid grounds of extraordinary miracles, wrought by the power of God, and which did <hi>demonſtrate</hi> to all equal judges, That it was the Spirit of God which both taught them ſuch myſteries of Faith as they preached, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame by ſuch ſigns and wonders, as did appear generally at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Goſpel. Now what doth all or any of this concern the ſuppoſed particular, inward, tacit teſtimony, whereby it is ſaid a man is to be aſſured of his Salvation: And no more do the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the end of the ſame Chapter prove, too long to be recited: but this<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35, 36 37, 38, 39.</note> is briefly to be anſwered. 1. That they ſpeak not at all of any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, ſingle Chriſtian, but of the Church of God, and that indefinitely or at large: <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath ſo determined to plant, propagate, and maintain that Religion, into which divers were collected by the miniſtry of the Apoſtles, that whatever, or from whomſoever, evils might befall the Church of God, yet they ſhould never prevail with ſuch perſecutions to ſeparate the faithful from Chriſt: no not all the Powers nor Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on Earth, nor all the Angels of Heaven, or of Hell.</p>
                     <p>But to ſecure theſe and the like teſtimonies the better, to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome much admired perſons of the Reformation (peradventure ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting what might be anſwered) have proceeded to ſay, <hi>That what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Calvin. Inſt.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt hath made to his Church, do equally concern every Chriſtian as well as the Church:</hi> which I cannot yield to, without theſe Exceptions: Firſt, That it may be underſtood of a particular Church, as well as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons. But (as may hereafter appear) God hath made no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe to any particular Church ſo far, that it can be any point of Faith to believe that Gods counſel &amp; decree are ſuch to it, as never to ſuffer it to Apoſtatize from him: So that no individual Church can be ſure of its perſeverance in the truth: and if not that, how ſhould any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon claim ſo much? But the Promiſes of Chriſt being taken (as they ought) of a Church indefinitely, it is moſt agreeable to Gods word to maintain an infallible perpetuity of the ſame. Again; It is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that all this while, we are ſpeaking, not ſo much of certainty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God (according to which we may yield the Salvation of men to be infallible) but certainty before men; or to the party concerned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, which we call <hi>Aſſurance</hi> or <hi>Evidence.</hi> In the body of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church, it is certain in it ſelf, that many men ſhall be ſaved, but not certain to us that any one therein ſhall; nor evident to any one, that <hi>he</hi> ſhall.</p>
                     <p>To the reaſons taken from the Power of God, who is able to ſave, and reveal this; And the truth of God, who is faithful in his Promiſe; And the Knowledge of God, that he knoweth who are his; what need we make any anſwer, beſides ſhowing the vanity of that inference which is drawn from the poſſibility of any thing, to the Fact it ſelf? and of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, rather than faith, which leadeth men to aſſure themſelves of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55232:61"/>
benefit of the promiſes, which are conditional, before it be evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that ſuch conditions have been duly obſerved by them. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this uneven dealing and unreaſonable concluſion, upon ſuch a ſuppoſal, hath prevailed with ſome to make the promiſes of Salvation ſo free, as not to conſiſt with any condition, but peremptory, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, yea, excluding Faith it ſelf (the laſt thing of all that their Religion will ſuffer them to deny God) as a Condition; making the only uſe of it to be, to receive what is ſo freely given them, as they falſly and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine.</p>
                     <p>It will not, after this, be neceſſary to lay down the reaſons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, having already ſhewed, That there is no Precept for ſuch a point of Faith, no Propoſition declaring it, no Article of our Creed requiring it, that falling very ſhort of it which teacheth us to believe in God: wherein they ſay three things are impoſed on us to believe. Firſt, That there is a God. Secondly, That this God is my God. Thirdly, That I muſt truſt and put my confidence in him for my ſalvation: All which we readily aſſent unto. But the moſt pertinent of all theſe come not home to the caſe before us. For every man may, and ought to put his confidence in God for his Salvation: and yet be never ſo much as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his Salvation, as is plain: and that upon this reaſon, That the well grounding of ſuch a confidence as this latter, may be very obſcure to him, and ſo the thing it ſelf not clear. Again, It is preſcribed by the Lords Prayer, and other places of Scripture, to pray daily for Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, ſaying, <hi>Forgive us our ſins, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us:</hi> this we are no leſs to pray for than for our daily bread. Therefore ſince we are not ordinarily ſo aſſured of the Pardon of them: For as a man hopeth not properly for what he hath, neither doth he pray for it, knowing he hath it. This St. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 18.</note> proves, ſaying; <hi>Where remiſſion of ſin is, there is no more offerings for ſin: i. e.</hi> where the remiſſion of our ſins is known to us. Praying being our Sacrifice under the Goſpel. This were ridiculous, and diſpleaſing to God, we thereby implying that we have not that which we know we have; which were unthankfully done of us. God in ſuch caſes expecting juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from us, acknowledgment of his Grace, conferring ſuch a bleſſing by all humble and devout Praiſe and Thankſgiving for it, and not abſurdly petitioning him as if we had it not. And this is ſo convincing upon ſome, that I find a bold profeſſion in theſe words, <hi>The fourth Petion</hi> [in the<note place="margin">Perkins.</note> Lords Prayer] <hi>muſt be underſtood not ſo much of our old ſins or debts, as of our preſent and new ſins.</hi> I grant we muſt petition for pardon for our new ſins: but I deny that we are not daily to repent and beg mercy at Gods hands all the dayes of our Life, for our ancient, as well as moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner offences. And therefore the ſame Author ſuſpecting (it may be) the inſufficiencie of this anſwer, proceedeth; <hi>I anſwer again: We pray for the pardon of our ſins, not becauſe we have no aſsurance thereof, becauſe our aſſurance is ſmall: we grow on from grace to grace in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Which is very ſoundly and ſoberly ſpoken, but quite overthrows what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contended for about Certainty. For Aſſurance that is weak and ſmall, is no aſſurance; but a competent degree, and a comfortable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hope and probability: which we not only allow, but know to be enjoyned us in holy Scripture by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Make your calling and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55232:61"/>
he profeſſes, that his Salvation is ſure before God, and that he ſhall in that conjuncture, never fall; but this is not made ſo ſure thereby to himſelf; and one reaſon is included in the very words, which are, <hi>If ye do theſe things:</hi> which implyes that ſuch things may be omitted, and expreſs the conſequence thereupon.</p>
                     <p>And not only doth this premature Certitude take us off from Prayer and Repentance, which alone deſtroy all true Faith in us, and under a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhew of moſt ſupream and firm aſſurance, leave us really deſtitute of the proper means to attain that good degree of perſwaſion to the quieting of the troubled and diſtruſtful Conſcience, but it alſo quite alienates the mind, and enfeebles the hands of faithful men, in the vigorous purſuit of obedience; without which no man ſhall be ſaved. For, as a man cannot, needs not, repent of what he knows to be ſo fully forgiven, nor ask that pardon again, which he is thoroughly perſwaded is granted him: So neither can any man with that ſolicitude and reſolution purſue the means of Salvation principally ſeen in obeying Gods Laws with Faith in Chriſts merits, when his mind ſhall be wholly poſſeſſed with an opinion, that the principal end next to the glory of God, is abſolutely ſatisfied, namely his ſoul ſaved.</p>
                     <p>They ſay indeed that the meditation hereof ſhould rather quicken, and incite men to a more exact walking with God, out of a greater obligation of gratitude, and common ingenuity, to make returns anſwerable to the ſingular Grace conferred. 'Tis true, it ſhould ſo, indeed. And ſo ſhould an inheritance put actually and irrevocably into the ſon and heirs hands, before the death of the Father. But how many inſtances have we, That ſo it is not; for one, That ſo it is? Or who can ſay, That ingenuity and good natur'dneſs are generally as powerful to keep up order and vertue in the world, as the propoſing of future favours and penalties to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned? We are not therefore to judge of the future motions, of<note place="margin">Quod non me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitur contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur, quod contemnitur utique non coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

To obey God abſtractively, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſecluding the fears and hopes we have from that ſervice, is to do it for Gods ſake, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be the moſt noble principle a man can act by; but when the Evils imminent on diſobedience, or the Bleſſing enſuing our obedience tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly affect us, we then will move upon a natural principle actuated and promoted by Faith.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this, the Sum of what a good Chriſtian is to believe in this point, is</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The immutableneſs of God in his covenanting with man, and the mutableneſs of man on his part, in fulfilling the tearms he is tyed to God in. Both theſe are intimated to us in theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which are vulgarly brought againſt us; <hi>viz. Nevertheleſs, the foundation of God</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> The firſt foundation of God, is that which he hath layed in his aſſuring us, that he will have a Church in deſpite of all Enemies and Perſecuters, which would deſtroy it. The ſecond is the ſeal to this Charter; which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſpecial perſons, is twofold: The Firſt, That <hi>God knoweth who are his;</hi> that is, (according to Scripture phraſe) owneth and aſſerteth the cauſe of thoſe that are his, and will never forſake them, otherwiſe than he hath declared; that is, they not violating egregiouſly the Covenant on their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55232:62"/>
parts. The ſecond is that which follows; viz. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> This is the ſeal ſet to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made by God; which if not duly and proportionably, to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourableneſs of the Evangelical Covenant, obſerved by man, the ſeal of God avails but little to the benefit of a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond concluſion may be, That notwithſtanding God hath no where enjoyned us, under any forfeiture, to obtain this aſſurance; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to be alwayes ſo preſſing and proficient in Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, that, above his Capitulations or ordinary Promiſes made in his Word, he may communicate his pleaſure unto us, and good-will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular ſalvation of us. This hath been imparted unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and may again, when it ſeems good to God: But it is no Rule to us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A faithful Chriſtian ought to endeavour the attaining to a ſtrong and true degree of Hope, by Gods grace, and the working out of his Salvation with fear and trembling. For St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, That a man may arrive to ſuch a ſtate of aſſurance (as 'tis called) that, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and believing the undetermined mercy of God in the Goſpel, he may have confidence of Gods love towards him, his own conſcience not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him: as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 3. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>have we confidence towards God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, This ſenſe ſerves much to the comfort and tranquility of the mind of ſcrupulous Chriſtians, more than the holding of a peremptory aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Salvation: which they, who require it, cannot deny to be wanting to many faithful ſervants of God. For, when they conſider that the want of this aſſurance is no indication or character of a Reprobate, as ſome would make it (and they muſt, who bring it under precept and promiſe) then are they heartened ſtill to preſs towards holy and devout exerciſes, believing that God, not ſeeing nor judging as man judgeth, nor as they of themſelves, but out of his incircumſcribed mercie, may accept them, and have mercy on them. And here properly doth that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, commended in the Articles of our Church, as very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, take place; <hi>viz.</hi> as that which, when we have done all, we muſt betake ourſelves unto, and which brings us neereſt to God: namely, not that we believe we are juſtified for, or becauſe we believe we are, freely; but becauſe Faith, and truſt in God, as it is the firſt ſtone in our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly building, ſo is it the crown and conſummation of all, when we diſown and diſavow all ſufficiencie in ourſelves, or our moſt Chriſtian Acts, even Faith it ſelf; and truſt in his mercy to be accepted, under all our fears and reaſonings to the contrary; not manifeſtly violating the Covenant with God, for which our own hearts and ordinary apprehenſions may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us.</p>

                        <p> Of the Contrary to true Faith, Apoſtaſie, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and Atheiſm. Their differences. The Difficulty of judging aright of Hereſie. Two things conſtituting Hereſie. The Evil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, and the falſeneſs of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. How far and when Hereſie deſtroyes Faith. How far it deſtroyes the Nature of a Church.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THus having ſufficiently treated of the moſt general and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Effect of Faith; before we leave this, we are in reaſon to enquire into that which privatively relates to true Faith, and that is, Hereſie; What that is? and wherein it conſiſteth? For Hereſie cannot properly be applyed to any but ſuch who are of the Faith; and in ſome degree belong to the Catholick Church: wherein it is diſtinct from Atheiſm, Apoſtaſie, and profeſſed Infidelity. For Infidelity, though it carries with it in its name, a ſenſe which comprehends both Atheiſm and Apoſtaſie, yet uſe hath prevailed ſo far as to apply it only to ſuch who do receive ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith, and them fundamental too, though not as the Chriſtians. For Example: Infidels may believe there is a God, and that God but one, and that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt, and Life everlaſting, either in miſery or bliſs: yet being either wholly ignorant of, or directly denying ſome fundamental Points of Faith, as Chriſtian, they continue Infidels, though not Atheiſts. Neither can they be accounted Hereticks, having never been of the Church, nor initiated into, or embraced the true Faith. Theſe are Negatively only related to the Church, as Logicians ſay, Diſſimilary things relate one to another, <hi>viz.</hi> A black thing to a white: But Hereſie is of a privative ſenſe, and an oppoſition to the true Catholick Faith, with an Obligation not only taken from the matter of Faith it ſelf, to which all the world owe homage and obedience, but from ſome extrinſecal formalities whereby ſome men more eſpecially contract a relation to the Church of Chriſt. And the firſt and moſt principal cauſe hereof is, the ſolemn dedication which is made by ourſelves, or others (we not oppugning it) of us in the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rite of Baptiſm: wherein renunciation is openly made of all things, perſons, and opinions, contrary and inconſiſting with that Doctrine we there ſubmit unto, and vow to obſerve. This Dedication of us to Chriſt, doth make and denominate us Chriſtians; and Catholicks, according to the leſs ancient uſe of the word, of which we ſhall hereafter ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Now, according to the degree or manner of violating this moſt ſolemn and ſacred Vow in Baptiſm, are men ſaid to be Apoſtates and Hereticks.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55232:63"/>
And an Apoſtates are Hereticks, but not all Hereticks, Apoſtates. The principal difference conſiſteth in this: 1. That the Apoſtate doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce even the firſt principles of Chriſtian Faith, as Chriſtian: And they are they which are expreſly contained in the form of Baptiſm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became a Chriſtian. 2. In a formal profeſſion contrary to ſuch Covenant made with God in Chriſt. But Hereſie doth not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Grounds of Chriſtianity it ſelf, but, whether by affected errour, or invincible; doth reſolutely and firmly aſſert things contrary to true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p>But to give a preciſe definition of Hereſie, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of old, ſo we find at this day, very difficult, and not to turn to the right hand or to the left; not to make it too broad and wide, nor too narrow and rigorous.

                        </note> For lighter errours againſt the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and peace of the Church, being maintained with obſtinacy, and againſt due propoſal of the truth, do characterize and conſtitute an Heretick. The other is the material part; namely, That about which men do err in Faith. And this hath a peculiar difficulty in it, ariſing from the undetermined points of Faith, and, I think a moral impoſſibility (as they call it) to define what are thoſe ſo neceſſary points of Faith, to be believed; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal where of makes an Heretick. This is thought generally to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explained in the Creeds of the Church, by ſome. But others find many conſiderable points not therein comprehended, unleſs by ſuch a reduction whereby any thing, almoſt, may be compelled to come under anothers wing. There are therefore that hold that the decrees and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Counſels fully and only can ſatisfie this ſcrupulousneſs; and no queſtion but all theſe conduce very much to the acquiring a ſettled Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in matters of Faith; and eſpeially this latter: againſt which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, there may be made theſe following exceptions. Firſt, That all things defined by Councels, and that with the affixing of Anathema's, are confeſſedly not of Faith, but of Rites, and Order alſo. Secondly, That thoſe Canons which are of Faith are ſo variouſly and miſerably handled, and diſtracted by Learned Interpreters, that a ſober well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian may, without any heretical pravity of mind, fall involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55232:63"/>
into a reputed Hereſie. Thirdly, That contrary things have ſometimes been determined in ſeveral ages. From all which it is manifeſt, That it is much more eaſie to define Hereſie then an Heretick: becauſe there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of perſonal averſion from, or oppoſition to the Truth, which can ſcarce be diſcovered: but in the abſtract, Hereſie may properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be defined, to be (not an opinion) but a <hi>Falſe Propoſition contrary to the Catholick Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if it be thus uncertain and obſcure what Hereſie is, through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various kinds and degrees thereof, anſwerable to the ſeveral branches; therefore, it cannot be eaſie to prove, all Hereſie in the common notion, as oppoſite to Faith, to be deſtructive to Faith. That it deſtroyes that Part of Faith againſt which it is bent, is undeniable: but that any particular Errour ſhould deſtroy the whole, any farther than it is oppoſite to the whole Body of Faith, is incredible. Some Hereſies pluck up the Tree of Life, Faith, by the roots; ſome cut it down to the root; ſome lop off the arms; ſome, leſſer branches; and ſome, which have been reputed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, do only bruſh and beat off the leaves and ornaments. An example of the former is given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> ſome of whom, it ſhould ſeem, denied the Reſurrection in general, and by neceſſary implication of Chriſt, who was as dead as any mortal man elſe. <hi>But if there be no reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 13, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>of the dead, then is Chriſt not riſen: And if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is alſo vain.</hi> It were to no purpoſe to believe any point in Chriſtian Religion, dis-believing that of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And in ſhort, to deny any thing expreſſed, or neceſſarily, and immediately included in the form of words uſed in Baptiſm, is to root up all our Creed, and render all our Faith vain in other Articles. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſecond ſort of Hereſie, may be, to deny the Mediation of Chriſt by way of ſatisfaction for us, reſtraining the interceſſion of him to that ſuppoſed one, now in Heaven: Of the third, may be Errours about Free-will, and affirming a poſitive neceſſity to commit ſin againſt God: Of the denyal of the efficacy of Good works done in Chriſt, towards our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and the affirming a meritoriouſneſs in them towards the ſame: Of the laſt, the affirming it unlawful to uſe any Ceremonies in Gods ſervice, but what are ſpecially commanded in his word.</p>
                     <p>And from hence it ſeemeth neceſſary to diſtinguiſh Hereſies and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, into Formal or direct, and Virtual and real.

In like manner, the neceſſary conſequence of a light
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55232:64"/>
Errour being very notorious, though a perſon be not formally an Heretick in the concluſion, which he may proteſt againſt, as not following from his erroneous propoſition, yet if in truth it doth ſo, and is generally ſo repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the mis-leading of Chriſtians, ſuch a man is really or virtually an Heretick, and obnoxious to the guilt and puniſhment due unto ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which he denies. For inſtance; It is a notorious Hereſie to hold it unneceſſary there ſhould be any Church of Chriſt, and to affirm, That it ſuffices that every good Chriſtian hath the word of God, and believes, and lives by himſelf, (though the word of God contradicts this impiety ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently) and to be a Chriſtian at large. If any perſon heretically incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall deny that this is his opinion, or that thus he would have it; yet if he preaches ſuch Doctrine, and publiſhes ſuch Opinions, which do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer thus much, he is a notorious Heretick in reality, though not in the formality; As alſo, if he ſhould teach, The Church hath no power to enjoyn any thing beſides what the word of God requires. This Errour taken ſimply and nakedly, hath no ſuch monſtrouſneſs as may not paſs for tolerable, but in the neceſſary conſequence, it is as pernicious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Chriſtians, as to preach againſt Chriſt himſelf. And therefore the argument of late Rationaliſts is very falſe founded upon this ground,<note place="margin">Socinus. Chi.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtians are not to be obliged under pain of damnation, ſuch as Anathema's and Excommunications are, to any thing which Chriſt hath not by his Law preſcribed: For this indeed taken ſtrictly, is true, Chriſt (for ought may appear) doth not in Scripture command Rites in uſe with the Church; but Chriſt, under pain of his diſpleaſure, doth require that we ſhould do all things not contrary to his injunctions, for the keeping up<note place="margin">Non ſunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va exiſtiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſine quibus magna conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere enim poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſint. <hi>Hieron.</hi>
                        </note> of the nature of a Church and Chriſtian Society; and therefore, though the Errour be in it ſelf light, it falls in the event, heavy upon Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, and deſerves no leſs rigour than is uſed towards the offender in Faith it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, From hence we may reaſonably judge of the frequent denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of alienation from the Faith and Church, againſt them who erred heretically: affirming in general, That Hereſie quite alienated from the Church, and that Society could not be of the Church which maintained an Hereſie. For firſt, we are to note that few or none before St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, were ſo ſeverely cenſured by the ancient Fathers, but ſuch as were offenders againſt the very principles of Chriſtianity it ſelf. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed, and others from him extended this cenſure to ſuch as were leſs criminal: For it is a very hard matter to inſtance in any one Article of Faith (though I know ſome great Clerks have attempted it) which Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Donatiſts rejected, or offended againſt. So that (abating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the vehemence of the zeal conceived againſt ſuch enemies to the Church, in the writings of Fathers againſt Hereticks) it will appear, that it was matter of Fact, rather than Faith, or Hereſie which expoſed them to ſuch cenſures. For uncharitableneſs will as certainly damn, as unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And he that dies for Chriſt (as divers Hereticks did) in animoſity, groundleſs againſt his brother, and eſpecially againſt the Church (of which he is, or ought to be a member) may notwithſtanding, looſe his Life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as well as here. But of this more, now we are to ſpeak of the Church.</p>

And that God is the Author and only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor of ſuch a Church, if it needed any proof, the Scripture would ſoon afford it: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 7. <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>But as God hath diſtributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk, and ſo ordain I in all Churches.</hi> And ſo exhorteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to <note n="†" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 12</note>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55232:65"/>
we read of Gods Calling, and chooſing and electing, we are not ſo much to underſtand the eternal purpoſe or decree of God, but the execution thereof in Gods actual calling and electing certain perſons to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and belief of the Faith of Chriſt: which he effected by the fulfilling of the Propheſie made by Chriſt in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, relating to the<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 31.</note> deſtruction of the Jewiſh Polity and Church; and erecting of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an inſtead thereof: <hi>viz. And he ſhall ſend his Angels</hi> [that is his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Miniſters] <hi>with a great ſound of a trumpet, (i. e.</hi> the Goſpel preached and publiſhed) <hi>and they ſhall gather together his elect (i. e.</hi> ſuch as he ſhall make choice of) <hi>from the four winds, (i. e.</hi> from all quarters of the world) <hi>from one end of heaven to the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now theſe perſons, by Gods word and good-will called from ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, ignorances, and vices, are in the Scripture called <hi>Saints;</hi> not ſo much becauſe they were all ſo throughly, or abſolutely ſanctified from their former, natural, or moral impieties contracted in their ſtate of Nature and Gentiliſm, as that they ſhould retain no ſin; and none of them ſhould fail of heaven hereafter. But firſt, either from the better part, the whole was denominated actually holy; which is not unuſual in all ſpeech: Or becauſe, having made renunciation of the World and Fleſh and Devil in Baptiſm, they were called and conſecrated to Holineſs: Or laſtly, becauſe they made open and ſolemn profeſſion thereof, however ſome ſo called, might be, and did appear to be reprobates: And names and appellations are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not from any inward affection or quality, which ſenſe cannot judge of, but from ſuch things as are viſible and apparent. And thus in the Old Teſtament, as well as New, it is used. As in the Pſalmes, <hi>Gather my Saints</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 50. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>together unto me: thoſe that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice:</hi> which imply the whole body of the people of Iſrael, as the words going immediately before, do alſo declare. And wherever in the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> (which is in divers places) we find the Congregation of the Saints, is meant the Iſraelites in general. And in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7. v. 8. 21, 22, 25, 27. is the word neceſſary taken. Now it being moſt cuſtomary with the Penmen of the New Teſtament, to borrow the phraſe of the Old, this tearm <hi>Saints</hi> was tranſlated from the Jewiſh Synagogue to the Chriſtian Church, by St. Paul, expreſly to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaying: <hi>To all that be in</hi> Rome <hi>beloved of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1: 7.</note> 
                        <hi>God called Saints;</hi> ſo the original better then the inſertion of <hi>to be,</hi> made in the tranſlation. As likewiſe in his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians; <hi>To the Church of God, which is at Corinth, to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. v. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeſus; called</hi> [to be] <hi>Saints withall that in every place call upon the name Jeſus Chriſt, their Lord and ours.</hi> And the like ſalutation we ſhall find in moſt of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, as alſo moſt frequently in the <hi>body</hi> of them: as may be obvious to any reader: though I deny not but ſometimes in the New Teſtament it is taken in a more reſtrained ſenſe, ſignifying eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the victorious and triumphant, not Militant Saints. From all which it doth ſufficiently appear in what ſenſe the Church may, and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Society, or Collection of Saints: And withal, how miſerably and miſchievouſly they err, who giving that title to a Party, hold themſelves bound to gather a certain ſelect number out of Chriſtians not accuſable of any notorious errour from the Faith of Chriſt, (as the Apoſtles of Chriſt did out of Heathens and Jews) and to conſtitute and call them <hi>Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another thing requiſite to the conſtitution of a Church is, That it be a <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> it ſufficing not, that perſons elected or ſelected (as above-ſaid) be many in number, but holy by nature or inſtitution; as God

The one Inviſible with one Head, Chriſt. The other Viſible and external, with one another. For the Apoſtle tells us, ſpeaking of Chriſtians, <hi>The head of every man is Chriſt.</hi> And to the <hi>Epheſians; The</hi>

                        <hi>husband is the head of the wife, even as Chriſt is the head of the Church: and and he is the Saviour of the world.</hi> There can therefore no queſtion be made, but it is moſt eſſential as well to the Church in general, as every particular Chriſtian or Member of the ſame, that Chriſt be the Head of his Church: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> yet more clearly expreſſeth it to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt ſuch Profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion as <hi>held not the Head, from which all the Body by joynts and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred and knit</hi>

                     <p>IN the outward Communion of the Church two things are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into: Firſt, the Nature of it, wherein it conſiſteth.

Firſt, we ſhall treat<note place="margin">Civitas à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſatione multorum dicta eſt, pro eo quod plurimorum in unum conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at &amp; contineat vitas. <hi>Origin.

                        </note> briefly of the Nature of this Communion. To underſtand which clearly, it will be expedient to begin with the definition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in General, or Society humane: For Communion is nothing elſe but Humane Society. And Humane Society is nothing elſe but a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of men out of natural reaſon inclining and moving them thereunto, for the mutual ſupply of the particular defects and exigencies each man is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55232:66"/>
ſubject unto in a ſeparate condition. And this Society thus combining or concurring together is commonly called a Republick: the word ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The common good: it being the deſign and end of all Republicks or Common-wealths for men, firſt in order to ſeek the common intereſt and good of the whole Society, and ſo through that to derive particular and private benefit to each member thereof, and not, as ſome blindly and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly addicted to their private perſonal profits, to begin at home; and not to ſecure the Publick ſtock. Theſe are no better than ſuch Pilferers and Thieves, who being in partnerſhip with others, pocket up in the firſt place all that they can lay hold on, and contribute no more to the common ſtock than they are by force conſtrained unto.</p>

For Order, as ſeveral of the Ancient have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it, is nothing elſe but The Diſpoſition [or placing] of equal and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual things into their proper places: which Order is the foundation of Government. And Government (according to <hi>Thomas</hi>) is the moving of men to their due end. There being therefore a twofold end of man; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſpiritual: Government likewiſe muſt be anſwerable. And both agree in this, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the Adminiſtration of the Weal Publick to ends agreeable unto them. In which we are yet farther to conſider theſe things. 1. The Original of Government. 2. The Form of Government. 3. The Rule and Reaſons of Government. 4. The Obligation upon Men under Government. And of theſe briefly; as a neceſſary Introduction to the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the firſt, the Cauſe and Fountain of all Government: Some pretending to fetch the Fountain head of all humane Rule from its firſt riſe, have quite forgot what they went about; and inverting the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, have begun at the end; which is rather the effect, then cauſe. For now we do not enquire, why, or to what end it is? but who made it, and whoſe hand it was that framed this Tool to bring to paſs ſuch a work as humane ſafety and tranquility. That this muſt be the ſame cauſe with that of man himſelf, ſeems reaſonable to me to conclude, from the neceſſity of the ſame, and the wiſdom of Divine Providence; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given generally ſuch inſtinct and common prudence unto Creatures to do nothing which ſhall ſerve for nothing: nor to erect any thing, but with competent proviſion to conſerve and continue the ſame in that being, ſo far as the Supream Wiſdom ſhall not oppoſe the ſame; How is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that God ſhould make that Maſter-piece of his, Man, upon earth, and not at the ſame time provide for that ſubſiſtance and continuance<note place="margin">Sevorum &amp; beſtiarum (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit <hi>Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Polit. 3. cap. 6)</hi> non eſt Civitas <gap reason="foreign">

But it is plain, that man though as brutiſh, and a ſenſible creature, he may wear out, poſſibly an unhappy, ignoble life, yet without ſociety and community and unity, through the bands and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſound and reaſonable Laws, cannot ſubſiſt, as civil or rational, or as eaſily improvable to perfection of natural ſtate upon earth: but muſt neceſſarily degenerate into the rank of Brutes. Therefore ſure Divine Wiſdome left him not deſtitute of ſuch helps as were proper to this end; but together with his very nature inſtills into him an inclination to Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and by his own Act and Ordinance, whereby he ordained that man ſhould propagate and multiply, preſcribed the beſt and only manner
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55232:66"/>
of civil Regiment; inveſting ſome with a natural right of dominion over others: As the man over the woman; and the parents over the children: from whence it is ready and eaſie to approach to a community, and that with a ſubordination. This is ſo plain, that the perſpicuity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city doth, rather then any thing elſe, offend the unſatisfied acuteneſs of rarer wits; and move them to pry farther to confound themſelves, others, and the Order God hath ſet in the world: beginning at the feet and ending in the head, and putting counſel into the tail to teach the head how it ſhould rule the body: and empowring children to enact Laws for Parents, how they ought to govern; which they certainly do, who affirm that the groſſer body of the people did firſt of all agree upon Government, and conſtitute their Ruler: which dogmes have no fewer nor higher arguments to confute and oppreſs them than theſe. Firſt, they are Ridiculous. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Sacrilegious and Impious. Thirdly, Impoſſible. Fourthly, Peſtilential and Pernicious to all Government.</p>
                     <p>It is firſt ridiculous, as that opinion which inverts all order, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a much more ſound and ſober Rule in Politicks; <hi>viz.</hi> That no man can create one greater than himſelf. And if it be ſaid that therefore no ſingle one can confer greater power than he himſelf is poſſeſſed of on another, but Many who are greater than one, may: I anſwer, This is true, where the ſuppoſition which is here falſe, and taken for true, is granted; <hi>viz.</hi> That many men have in ſuch caſes as theſe any more power then one. For I wholly deny that any are, or altogether have any right, whatſoever power they may uſurp, to create ſuch Powers: And it ſtill remains abſurd to ſuppoſe that any, or all whoſe only place and capacity it is to ſerve, ſhould more then command: For, 'tis a true ſaying, <hi>It is more to make a King, than to be a King.</hi> For ſtill I hold this which I have not found ſhaken by the many attempts of innovating Wits, that there is a real Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power in lawful Princes. And though we ſhould ſuppoſe that, which was rarely, if ever done, that a man ſhould adopt any man into the place of a Father, as men uſually did ſome, as their ſons; yet can we not ſuppoſe, that hereby any paternal Power is really conferred on ſuch an one, but only imaginary; and impediments removed whereby Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power, which hath an acknowledged common right to Rule, take place over ſuch a perſon, as hath ſo ſubmitted unto it. So in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it cannot be denyed againſt innumerable inſtances to be given; that the People, in certain exigencies and faileurs, have as it were adopted one man ſpecially as their civil Parent, whom we call commonly a King: and hereupon abſurdly and proudly conclude, they have made a King: but we know this to be nothing ſo. For 'tis not choice, but Power that makes a King: and in this caſe no power at all is given, or can be given; nor in truth ought to be taken away as the manner is from Princes entring through the populacie, into the Throne. For God only is the proper and immediate Author of Right and Power, which he hath inſerted into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents over their Children; and hath proportionably preſcribed to Kings and Princes, without ever adviſing with the People, or expecting their conſent or confirmation: This the Scripture it ſelf calls <hi>Jus Imperii,</hi> or<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 9.</note> lefs ſignificantly with us, <hi>The Manner of the King.</hi> Reaſon calls the ſame <hi>Juſtice:</hi> which never takes its meaſure from earth originally, but from heaven: not from the People, but from God.

For it ſheweth no more than this, That in truth God being the true and proper Lord of the <hi>Mannour,</hi> this dominion is devolved unto him, and not to the People. And that even in ſuch caſes a tacit hand of God is ſeen by many eminent Inſtances in Hiſtories, deſigning the Perſon receiving that Rule; the People being but ſo many Stewards of Gods Court, in admitting a new Tenant to Kingly Power. <hi>For by me</hi> (ſaith the<note place="margin">

Yet doth not all this contradict the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Subjects, who having long continued under equal and reaſonable Laws, explaining and particularly applying the common Supream Law of Juſtice to a State or People, do preſent ſuch Rules of Regiment to their future Prince, for his confirmation: unleſs they be ſo far urged on him who hath a Perſonal Right by Birth to ſucceed in the Throne, as to deny abſolutely to ſubmit to him without ſuch conditions yielded unto. Indeed, could they prove the Right of <hi>Choice</hi> of the Perſon, to be the ſame with the <hi>Power</hi> belonging to the Place, they might mangle, alterate, and adulterate it as they pleaſed: For 'tis a Law, that a man free from Rulers (as theſe are ſuppoſed now to be) may do what he will with his own: and chooſe whether he will part with any of it, or not; and what, and how much he will give away: but it not being ſo, and a duty lying upon him of being Juſt: <hi>He that</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith) <hi>is unjuſt in the</hi>

                     <p>But thirdly, to ſhew that there can neither be Divine nor Natural Right in the People to chooſe or create Governours, and much leſs Government, the impoſſibility of the real and juſt execution of this power abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficeth. For if men, as ſome have been ſo blind and bold to affirm, were naturally free untill they brought this ſubjection upon themſelves: Then firſt this were general and without exceptions; or but partial, and with exceptions: If this latter be true, and ſome were naturally ſubject, This will deſtroy the principal dogme it ſelf, and open a way to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable reaſons againſt natural freedom: For that which we have by nature, we have in common, and without exception of the thing it ſelf, though peradventure with ſome diſcrimination in the degree and meaſure. But if the firſt be granted, That all are free; then muſt ceaſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubjection natural of children to their parents; which hath been with better advice and reaſon received, then it hath by ſome been well-nigh
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55232:67"/>
quite diſowned, to the making way for Novel Politicks. And again; Grant that all men were once (but no body could never tell when) and in a certain place, (but no body could ever tell where) equally free, or at leaſt, all of years of diſcretion, which is moſt uncertain; It would be known firſt, How men dare to be ſo preſumptuous as to make ſuch a breach of the Law of Nature as this muſt be; <hi>viz.</hi> To part with their birth-right, and to imbezel that which God had given them, concomitantly with their own lives. I ſay, what a notorious ingratitude, and an offenſe againſt God to alter nature it ſelf, who, we may well ſuppoſe, doth all things moſt conſonantly to Divine reaſon. If therefore men had this Liberty natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in them, I hold it no leſs a ſin to give it away, than for one to cut off a member of his body, or to deſtroy ones reaſon, if it lay in his power. And to ſay that the People, in ſuch caſes, do not abſolutely deveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of power, nor part with what God and Nature hath placed in them; becauſe they commit only to ſuch the Adminiſtration of ſuch power as is reſident in them radically; it being neither commodious nor poſſible for the univerſal Body to manage it ſelf, to the due ends of civil Society; but reſerve unto themſelves a right of Revocation, upon the Male-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or abuſe of Power ſo delegated: This is to traduce Divince Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wiſdom notoriouſly. For what can be a greater reproach to a wiſe man, or the moſt wiſe God, than to admit ſuch a groſs errour, as to ſo conſtitute and frame a thing to ſuch ends and purpoſes, which it can never attain; and to endow a people or perſon with ſuch a faculty which can never avail, nor ſucceed to the intention of it, and never be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as certainly Supream in the People cannot, but muſt be delivered over to another more capable ſubject. Thus it ſeemeth to me that ſuch ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed power ought not to be tranſlated from that ſubject to which God had annexed it, to that which the people liketh better, man here in mending Gods ordinance. Therefore ſurely there being found a neceſſity of having power otherwiſe poſited than in the people; and it being an egregious abſurdity of altering that God had ordained; it muſt follow, to reconcile theſe things, That there never was any ſuch power in the people at all; but what they have, is unto them derived from another Power originally.</p>
                     <p>And this is further confirmed from the Impoſſibility as well as impiety of making any ſuch tranſlation of power from its natural ſubject, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; becauſe it cannot ever fairly or juſtly be brought about: ſeeing that the People cannot unanimouſly, much leſs ever did concur to the Election of any one Government or Governour. They cannot all give in their Votes to ſuch an end; alwayes ſome were diſſenting: and if they did not enter their <hi>Proteſt</hi> againſt the proceedings of their fellows, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were deterred, curbed, and oppreſſed by a more prevalent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction obliging them, and conſtraining them moſt unjuſtly to comply with their Opinions and Decrees. For there appears no ſound reaſon why a more numerous and powerful faction may not as well take away my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, becauſe they are ſtronger than I, as take away my birth-right, which Liberty is here aſſerted to be. So that the very firſt ſtep to Liberty muſt be founded in injuſtice, in taking away that from me, which I might no leſs in natural reaſon ſpoil them of: and in ſervitude too, in bringing me whom they acknowledge to be naturally free, into unwilling ſubjection. Neither is the difficulty ſolved in ſaying, That Reaſon and Nature alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that for order ſake and regulating humane Society, the Minor part muſt yield to the Major. For upon this ſuppoſition indeed that power
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55232:68"/>
is ſo abſurdly and inconveniently poſited, there doth preſently appear ſuch a neceſſity: But my Argument is taken from the abſurdity of any ſuch neceſſity of natures creating, that the ſuppoſition is very falſe. And if it were true, yet were not that Maxime true which is here brought to controul and correct the ſame. For Nature doth not teach us, much leſs neceſſitate us in any caſe to follow the moſt numerous; but rather reaſon, and experience, and the judgment of diligent and wiſe diſcuſſers of this Point inform us, That the multitude are more inconſiderate, undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and injudicious, then the fewer in number, many times: the world being generally thicker ſet with fools, than wiſe men; and fools, being commonly more apt to be led by fools, than with deeper and ſounder reaſons of the Wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the right of Revocation reſting ſtill in the People, even after the ſuppoſed inveſtiture of Power made to a Prince, or other Magiſtrates; I muſt confeſs (upon ſuppoſition of a native right in them) it to be very reaſonable, yea though the contract be very binding upon them to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the perſons ſo inaugurated, in that State. And that from the grounds already laid down, which prove that no alteration ought to be made contrary to Divine or Natural Inſtitutions; and conſequently, the People being by natures Law Proprietaries in that Power, all alienations attempted muſt needs be void, any farther then they judge fit, yea and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too; becauſe they themſelves are bound to keep themſelves to ſuch innate Rights, and obſerve them duly. And beſides Civil and artificial Law, as I may well call <hi>Humane,</hi> can never extinguiſh Natural, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſtly And therefore what they gave, the People, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire back again; becauſe they received that entailed upon them and their Poſterity, which they ought not, nor can cut off. And this I ſay, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant what others have ſaid to the contrary, who are ſaid to yield ſupream Power in the body of the People, which they may diſpoſe of to another, but not revoke again, any more than a man may recover back his Eſtate once lawfully made over to another. But the diſparity of the caſes makes the anſwer very eaſie: which is, That no man being ſo naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a temporal eſtate, as is here ſuppoſed the People to be with this Right of Dominion, <hi>that</hi> may without any violation of a ſuperiour Law be parted with, and not <hi>this.</hi> For ſuppoſing equally, that God who hath given only a general right to man to poſſeſs the earth, and not aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any particular Lands to particular perſons to be holden of Divine Right, had done this latter, it would have followed, That he ought not to ſell them; and that ſuch ſale made, were void before God: As doth plainly appear in the diſtribution of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto ſeveral Tribes, by no means to be confounded: and of <hi>entailing</hi> of Lands unto particular Families, by no means ſo to be alienated, but they might return, at a time prefixed, to the ſame Houſe.</p>
                     <p>But the Right of Rule in the People is lookt upon as by Nature and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinance belonging to them, and therefore cannot [<hi>de Jure</hi>] be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; or, if attempted, muſt needs, by the ſame Right, be revokable. But I look not upon that Argument much uſed, as concluding againſt the pretended power of the People, which ſtands thus. No man hath power of life and death over himſelf. Therefore he cannot communicate this power eſſential to the Supream, to any other. For, is it not poſſible a man, who hath no ſuch power over himſelf (as in truth no man hath) may yet have over another, and this give unto another; from a concurrence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55232:68"/>
wherein One may receive a general dominion over many? But if no man could give the power of Life and Death to another, who cannot diſpoſe of his own Life; How could Kings themſelves grant that power to inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Magiſtrates, whenas themſelves have no power to take away their own lives, neither can they give power to another to take them away?</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing to be cenſured in the doctrine of the Peoples power, is the perniciouſneſs of it to all Empires and States, where it is infuſed into the minds of the Commonalty, and improved to actions naturally flowing from thence, as experience hath ſufficiently proved, as well as reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: of which latter (omitting here the odious inſtances, Hiſtories, and our own ſenſes have miniſtred unto us) we ſhall give theſe three only. Firſt, That if it were true that ſuch Power were radically and revocably in the people, the people never being able to judge with general conſent aright of the ſame thing, nor ſoberly and quietly to concur to the ſame concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through the infinite variety and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the Form of Civil Government. The ſeveral ſorts of Government. That Government in General is not ſo of Divine Right, as that all Governments ſhould be indifferently of Divine Inſtitution, but that one eſpecially was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and that Monarchical. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proving this.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Second thing to be here examined is the Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. To ſpeak orderly of which, it is neceſſary to call to mind the ſeveral forms or kinds of Government ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the World: which though according to the infinite variety of prevailing Factions, may alſo be infinite; yet may beſt be reduced to theſe two, <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or the Supremacy of One preſiding over all others within ſuch or ſuch Dominions; and <hi>Polycraſie,</hi> or <hi>Polyarchie,</hi> where many have the power in their hands of adminiſtring the Republick. And this again is ſubdivided into many forms. As Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycraſie here properly and ſtrictly taken (not as before, for any number oppoſite to One, but) for a great number of perſons inveſted with Civil Power. And Ariſtocracie, conſiſting of a Few comparatively with the others, and them of the Nobler, and richer of the People: And Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie, wherein the People are ſaid to retain the Power of Government in their own hands. But this laſt is only ſaid, and by ſome ignorant and undiſcerning people phanſied to be, rather than in reality is ſo, or ever was or poſſible for to be; and that upon the reaſons, amongſt divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, already given againſt the Peoples power. This the Philoſopher in<note place="margin">This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhews Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks lib. 4. cap. 4. initio.</note> his Politicks, doth in effect, as far as he dar'd, confeſs, amidſt ſo many pretenders to it. And they who diſpute of it, are conſtrained to deſert the proper genuine ſenſe of the word <hi>Democracie,</hi> which ſhould compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the people generally without excluſion of any, and to affix a new meaning to it, whereby many of the inferiour and ignobler ſort are taken into the numerous Counſel, and Court of Judicature, adminiſtring the Publick: And thus at this cheap rate are the people chouſed into a fond and empty opinion that they are <hi>ſome body,</hi> when 'tis not the thouſand part of them, who are at all actually concerned in Government. The Hiſtories of the frequent and vain, but fatal attempts made by the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Populacie to become Maſters of themſelves, and to Rule their Rulers, are more than enough to confute any man willing and able to learn what a <hi>Chimera</hi> ſuch a Government is, and what devaſtations rather than ſecurity ſuch preſumptions have expoſed Cities unto: who, when they were moſt popularly governed, and ſo ſhould be moſt free, never regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the leaſt the adjacent peoples freedom, which lived without their City, never admitted their Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55232:69"/>
to have done, if they would have made good their principles, which teach that Power is of right in the People, and conſequently that they ought to govern, and by no violence or fraud ought they to be defeated of this their pretended Birth-right: and they without the Gates in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts are of the ſame condition with Citizens. And if they recurr to the old hold of the Patrons of ſuch natural Rights in people, to ſay, That, notwithſtanding them, there muſt be ſome over-ruling power to bring things into ſettlement, and order; and therefore, the univerſal judgment and approbation of every perſon muſt not be expected: I as eaſily reply, and more ſtrongly conclude, That therefore there can be no ſuch natural Right in them ſo much as to preſcribe to themſelves; it being moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to affirm, as well as diſhonorable to God, to believe, That the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Providence ſhould ſo diſpoſe of Power, that unleſs humane wit mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, nay, quite changed it, it could never be exerciſed to the benefit of mankind.</p>
                     <p>And this being made good, not only muſt this Democracie be found a meer impoſture upon people, but the pretended Right of Government communicated unto the Chief in the other two <hi>Species</hi>'s of Government, Ariſtocracie and Polycracie. For theſe perſons muſt either profeſs a right growing up unto them from the powerful uſurpations and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by them over their brethren, the reſt of the people, who natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and juſtly were, and ought to be as free as themſelves (and ſo all the frame is founded in injuſtice) or this was freely communicated unto them from the people. But againſt this is ſufficient what we have often both ſaid and ſhewed before, That the People never had any ſuch Power, and if they had, ought not, nor could part with it, or remove it from that place and proper ſubject wherein it was by God ſeated and ſettled. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of theſe can be juſt or natural: for nothing that is unjuſt can be natural, or agree with the Divine Will.</p>
                     <p>And from hence is refuted the vulgar Warrant that is uſed to juſtifie, as indifferent in their kind, all ſorts of Civil Government, telling us, That God hath inſtituted Government in General, but not limited it to any one kind, but left it to the wiſdom and choice of men to pitch upon what Government beſt agrees with a Nation. But to what mens wiſdom? to ſome few? or to many? or to all men of that Nation? All, or the major part have no wiſdom, nor poſſibility to chooſe: Few, or many chooſing doth manifeſt injuſtice to the others. But what needs repetition of what is ſaid quite oppoſite to all this? This therefore is only here to be added, That the ſuppoſition here made is utterly falſe, and incongruous to the nature of all things elſe conſtituted by God, and contrary to the courſe of nature, and Gods manner of working, which apparently is not to begin with Generals, and ſo to proceed to Particulars: but firſt he makes Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As God did not at firſt make man in General, and then left ſome body elſe (as they thought) to make <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and the reſt: nor did he irſt and only make a living Creature in General, and then left the Angels, or ſome other unknown Creatures to us, to make what ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Animals they pleaſed out of that: but he firſt made <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo mans nature was made. He firſt made the Sun and Moon (ſo far as we read) and upon that followed, that he made great Lights. And the like method muſt of neceſſity be acknowledg'd in Gods Inſtitutions Moral and Civil: and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55232:70"/>
he muſt inevitably (ſo far as humane wit can reach) firſt ordain ſome one Government in particular, before he could be ſaid to be the Author of Government generally taken.</p>
                     <p>Now if it doth not at all appear, That God had any more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hand (whereby evil as well as good doth ſpring up in the World) in the inſtitution of any more than one ſort of Government; and that he did particularly pitch upon one, and gave inſtances and intimation of his choice of one, and nothing can be alleadged in behalf of the oppoſite to that, as proceeding, in any direct ſpecial manner, from him, then will the form of Government, we now ſeek after, commend it ſelf unto us. And this we ſhall do by giving the Divine Prerogatives, which Monarchical Government hath above others invented by man, to ſtand in competition with it. And this not by wading deep, or wandring far into an uncertain and tedious Diſputation of finding out reaſons on both ſides, which may ſeem to commend and prefer one above another, and ſo conſequently to conclude a divineneſs in one eſpecially; but by certain viſible indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motives evidencing this to every imprejudic'd mind.

                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:55232:70"/>Thirdly, the Paternal Power being acknowledged to be natural, and of Divine inſtitution, and differing from Monarchical and Regal, but as [<hi>Magis</hi> and <hi>Minus</hi>] the leſſer degree doth from the greater, the thing is in a manner yielded.</p>
                     <p>But fourthly, Divine Preſidents and Examples do further confirm this and that taken from the Word of God; in all which there is no mention at all made of any Government but Regal, though not alwayes under that name. For, before the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Father or Patriarch of them had this power without competitor. In the the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and Servitude of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had no publick Government beſides that of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> unleſs peradventure every Tribe had a Chief by ſucceſſion over them, without any Civil Autority. From their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the death of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> the Supremacie was in one; notwithſtanding ſubordinate Councels and Rulers conſtituted by <hi>Moſes.</hi> After <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> aroſe Judges by Gods ſpecial appointment, not many at once, thereby framing an Ariſtocracie, but one Eminent perſon giving Law to all others. And theſe differed from that of more formal Regal Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God at the deſire of the diſcontented people, in that before <hi>Saul,</hi> God kept the choice of their Governours more immediately in his own hand, and ordained them Deliverers and Judges according to his pleaſure, and occaſions offered: which was the reaſon (together with their rejecting of ſo eminent a Servant of God, as was <hi>Samuel</hi>) that God<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 10.</note> ſaid of the People, <hi>they had rejected him rather than Samuel.</hi> From <hi>Saul</hi> to the Captivity, it is manifeſt what their Government was; and from thence it matters not, as to our preſent purpoſe, how they governed themſelves, ſeeing they were ruled by the Regal Power of Foreign Princes: until ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off that yoke, they were brought under that form by their own Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers, which was again extorted from them by uſurping Tyrants. So that when <hi>Philo-Judeus</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſeem to write of an Ariſtocratical Government inſtituted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> they can no otherwiſe be underſtood to write faithfully, but in reference to Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and Caſes of Religion, purely; wherein the Counſel of many was to take place, but not to the adminiſtration of Civil Juſtice, unleſs, as is above-ſaid, when they were themſelves ſubject to Forrain Princes.</p>
                     <p>The Objections againſt this Form thus aſſerted, I leave to be anſwered from the poſitive grounds thus laid down: And commend the Reader to the learned Diſputations of others, which are many, concerning the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and benefits of one Form above another.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THAT we read not in the New Teſtament of any Rules or Advice given to Kings and Princes, how to govern the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under them, the reaſon is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe in thoſe dayes there were none Chriſtian: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>What</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>have I to do to judge them that are without?</hi> the Church: For doubtleſs, had any been of the Society of Chriſtians, they had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under the Chriſtian Diſcipline and Precepts of the Apoſtles: But that occaſion of inſtructing Kings in the due adminiſtration of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, failing, we are to ſeek for ſatisfaction from the old Teſtament: where not much is found, beſides general moral Precepts of Sobriety, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Juſtice, and the like enjoyned <hi>Solomon</hi> by <hi>David</hi> his Father; and left by <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> for Rules to ſucceeding Princes. <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe, not without Gods appointment, hath drawn up ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Precepts for Kings to follow, in the real and cordial embracing of Gods word and worſhip: and taking the defenſe and protection thereof. Of which to ſpeak, it little behoves us at preſent.</p>
                     <p>Neither purpoſe we out of Humane Arguments and Autority, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Supreams what they ought to do, or how to govern any farther than the known Rules of Juſtice in common do require: For, no doubt there is a mutual Obligation between Soveraign and Subject, and that he is tyed and circumſcribed in the exerciſe of his power, by God; as really, as this is in his Obedience to him: and that upon the common duties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> of Maſters to Servants, and Husbands to Wives, and Parents to Children. For it doth not at all follow, That becauſe Princes are not ſubject to their Subjects, therefore they are free from all ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 8.</note> No, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule holds good to Kings as well as to Maſters, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould know that their King and Maſter is in heaven: and that Kings are to be ſubject as well to the Laws of God, as their Subjects are to the Laws of Man. And though Children ought to obey their Parents in all things: yet there is tacitly underſtood certain Laws of Limitation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55232:71"/>
reſtraining the boundleſs tyranny of both civil and natural Parents. For Subjects and Children are to know that they have a higher Lord, and a more powerful Father, to whom in the firſt place obedience muſt be paid. And we muſt withdraw our ſelves from the commands of our Earthly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, when our Heavenly, who is his Soveraign, doth require it: as all rational Kings do grant, as well as People.</p>
                     <p>But neither ought we to reſtrain the will of Princes to the literal and expreſs will of God only, but even to the moſt juſt and reaſonable Laws of Humane Authority: but only we muſt diſtinguiſh the vaſt difference between the obligation of Subjects to the juſt and equal Laws preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and impoſed on them, and that of Princes, in relation to thoſe Laws concerning their governing. For all Laws contain two ſpecial cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in them: The one Exemplary, whereby a Form and Rule is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, directing ſuch as are to be guided thereby, to the obſervation of Juſtice, Equity, and Reaſon, as well to the publick as private good: And to this (ſo far as it is reaſonable) Kings are no leſs bound than Subjects: they ought to obſerve entirely and religiouſly theſe ſound and profitable Laws, and that under pain of Gods diſpleaſure. The other cauſality which Laws have, is Efficient and Compulſive; whereby a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil penalty being denounced, and impending over the head of the infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereof, they are better guarded from tranſgreſſions, by either loſs of outward good, or life it ſelf, according to the merit of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe.</p>
                     <p>It cannot either conſiſt with the Law of God or Nations, to inflict puniſhments on Princes Soveraign. Not but that, for inſtnace, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, adultery, unjuſt ſpoil, and robbery of the Subjects, may no leſs (conſidering the nature of the Crime) deſerve ſuch puniſhment of Princes, as they do of People; but becauſe there is none in ſuch caſes that can, or ought duly and regularly to execute ſuch Laws, becauſe there can be no ſuch execution without the power of the Sword; and there can be but one proper ſubject of that power in any one Republick. Every man muſt not put to death him that is a notorious offender, no not though he be juſtly and legally condemned to dye; but he, or they only who are thereunto rightly impowred and authorized by the Supream: And though every man may in his own mind and judgment, ſentence a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour whoſe crime is high and apparent, to death; yet cannot he in civil judicature, render him obnoxious to it. And the reaſon hereof is plain, becauſe <hi>Juſtice</hi> muſt be done <hi>juſtly,</hi> or elſe there is incurred no leſs guilt than is ſought, and intended to be revenged. And of all guilt, I know not whether any be greater than the aſſuming of ſuch a power, which no wayes belongs to a man. For better it were to take away ones horſe, or to raviſh another mans wife, or to extort unjuſtly anothers eſtate, than to deveſt a Prince of his Right of Rule, and uſurp it to himſelf; and that, firſt, becauſe no mans eſtate, or any thing that is his, doth deſcend to him, or otherwayes becomes his, by the like Divine title as the Supream Power rightly poſited and poſſeſſed, doth to the owner thereof: and, therefore this being more ſacred, the invaſion of this right is much more wicked and unjuſt. Secondly, Becauſe a publick miſchief, and of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral influence upon all, is much more intolerable than a private. But ſuch a violation of Princely Right, muſt of neceſſity draw on a publick miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon the whole civil Body; I mean, all the Subjects in ſuch a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who ſhall be diſtracted between the ſenſe of obedience known other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55232:72"/>
to be due, and the terrour of uſurped Power threatning ruin to ſuch as comply not with their unjuſtice.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo neceſſary and convincing a truth unto moſt men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent reaſon, though incompetent conſcience, they have ſought out an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, which, as occaſion may ſerve, may unqualifie Princes, and ennoble and enable Subjects to oppoſe in hoſtile manner the tyrannies, as they call them, of Princes. And the one ſtrikes high, and through the loyns of all Supremacie in ſingle Perſons; affirming that one man is not capable of ſuch a maſs of power, without apparent tyranny. And as for manifeſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, no great ſcruple, they think, ought to be made in repreſſing and curbing it, and reducing it into its proper bounds. This muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled by a more reaſonable and ſober judgment of tyranny. For 'tis a groſs and dangerous miſtake to look upon tyranny with ſuch a vulgar and evil eye, as to conceive that Plinipotencie and illimited Power is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyranny: And that tyranny is not ſo much the abuſe and unjuſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of power (which is the trueſt deſcription of it) but power it ſelf: and that it is not ſeparable from ſome kind of Government, as that which is abſolute and unconfin'd by Laws. But the firſt thing here ſuppoſed, and ſo commonly and boldly taught, is very falſe. For there is no ſuch thing as a Government in it ſelf tyrannical: and there is no one of all thoſe which have been, or may be invented, but may equally be ſubject to that imputation. And to be brief, there can no poſſible reaſon be given why the Government of one ſhould be tyranny, rather than that of many, of a Senate. Or, why people ſhould not be ſaid more truly to be free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, than this; the Laws being more benign and equal there than here? as who can deny but they may be, whatever actually they are? Nay, we ſee, that where moſt plauſibly and gloriouſly Liberty is pretended by Governours, and preſumed on by the credulous multitude, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the yoke of obedience is moſt heavy: and that a bold affirmation of a Free people prevails to the perſwaſion of men, that ſo in truth they are, contrary to common ſenſe: And all this chiefly from that fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errour, taken for an unqueſtionable truth; <hi>viz. That to be governed by many is a ſtate of Freedom; and by a ſingle Perſon, of tyranny.</hi> But tyranny is not proper to any one kind of Government, whether conſiſting of one, or more: It is in brief, no Government at all, but the exceſs and<note place="margin">

                     <p>And if it be a true and reaſonable diſtinction of Tyrants into <hi>Titled</hi> and <hi>Titleleſs;</hi> how is it poſſible, thoſe great, many, and zealous aſſertours of Popular Liberty, and invaders of Government, (as <hi>Junius Erutus</hi> with his Fellows) ſhould eſcape the due cenſure of the worſt of Tyrants, who expelling a Tyrant who had a Title, uſurped a power, to which he had no Title; and then proceeded to exerciſe an act, to which he had no power; <hi>viz.</hi> the thruſting out of his Equal and Collegue, collating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, poſſibly he might have afterward committed an offenſe, not that he had. This was a piece of tyranny, not exceeded by any before him. But it may be alleadged, That there is a Law, whereby it was free for any man to kill Tyrants; and ſome late Demagogues have written, for the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55232:72"/>
promotion of Religion (forſooth) as well as Civil Liberty, that to kill<note place="margin">Buchananus De Jure Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni apud Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</note> Tyrants (and here I will not ſhow whom they call Tyrants) is as good an act, as to ſlay Wolves, Lyons, and Bears. But I would fain know, whence ſuch a Law proceeded, if not from tyranny it ſelf? Even ſuch perſons, who, under colour of natural Law of returning evil for evil, and ſelf preſervation, have done the greateſt injuſtice imaginable, not only againſt the perſon perſecuted, but the people, who never at any time had power ſo to deliver themſelves, nor, if they had, did generally and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly, or could confer the ſame on the new Pretenders to it. That Law therefore of killing Tyrants, invented by Tyrants, taketh place on the Authors of it, as much as any body elſe; and, where the like power can be ſnatched up, may have the ſame event on popular States-men, as well as Kings and Princes: For they are Tyrants too.</p>
                     <p>The other ground of Reſiſtance of Supremacie abuſed by a ſingle Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, is commonly taken from a ſuppoſed right in Inferiour Magiſtrates, (as they are vulgarly called) to reſtrain the exorbitancies, and chaſtiſe the fury of immoderate Princes. This invention hath ſo much more of ſpeciouſneſ, than the former, by how much there is a ſound of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hope of greater order, and prudence, and formality of Juſtice, than could be expected from a diſorderly, ignorant, looſe and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant multitude: But being examined duly, will be found very rotten, and vain.

So that nothing can be more abſurdly and ſediciouſly taught than to make ſuch as are conſtituted by another, to have any authority at all over their Founder and Lord, the author of their power.</p>
                     <p>I know infinite inſtances may be brought of Common-wealths which have admitted, and been governed by ſuch a Co-ordination, or at leaſt a power reſerved in ſtore in the hands of certain perſons, whoſe proper office and care it ſhould be, to regulate and reduce to a ſafe mean, the extreams which ſingle and abſolute Monarchs may eaſily fall into. But all theſe varying ſo exceedingly from the natural form of Government, ſway not much with me. For that which is natural, and of Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and Inſtitution, cannot poſſibly be uncertain and mutable, ſo that no man ſhall be able to know where to place his duty of Obedience, which God requires to be paid to ſuch as are in Authority: And obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being due only to the Supream himſelf immediately, or to thoſe that derive authority from him, how is it poſſible to underſtand, but by the ſad effects of power preſſing and afflicting a man, where he is to yield his obedience. Therefore ſurely God can have no hand in ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellings of States which ſhall perplex a man in rendring his ſubjection. For it is not a great, empty, and ridiculous Title which maketh a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, but entire power, and abſolute freedom at leaſt from ſubjection to others, eſpecially of his own Dominion. All Titles without this, are honourable Mockeries: but the real Supremacy is actual (I ſay not how juſtly or injuriouſly, in thoſe Tutours of Princes and Keepers of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people, as is commonly given out: and in this caſe (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that Right and Power are not ſeparated) not theſe Proveditors or Senatours, who thus chaſtiſe Princes are rebellious, but they who bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of Kings and Princes, being in truth but meer ſubjects, refuſe to ſubmit to the decrees of their Superiours.</p>
                     <p>But if poſſeſſion giveth not Right, which is the moſt Chriſtian, as well as rational opinion, it may be doubted how a juſt title can be acquired by any Perſons in co-ordination to the Supream power, when as we have ſhown, the People never had any ſuch themſelves, and therefore can trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr none; nor ſuch ſelect perſons had any of themſelves, who aſſume this, nor is it to be conceived how any natural Right ſhould deſcend upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, as the Paternal power doth upon one, from whence Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Power and Right may flow. And If Senatours as they call them, or ſuck like States-men cannot regularly found their title in nature, or Divine Writ, or revelation, It was no act of Rebellion, that greateſt act of Hoſtility in <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> to reduce the Roman Common-wealth to Monarchy. For there are two things to be conſidered in Civil Authority, The Government it ſelf in its form and kind; and the Governour inveſted with this. The Perſon Governing may doubtleſs offend notoriouſly, though I dare not ſay forfeit to any other his Authority: but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf being abuſed cannot be in fault, or for any miſcarriages of the Perſon, lapſe to other. The Government is religiouſly to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſecured from adulterations and corruptions, even when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch is irreligiouſly diſcarded and dethroned. So that the Tyranny of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55232:73"/>
a ſingle perſon invading the Government adminiſtred by States, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating the Supremacy to himſelf alone, muſt needs be leſs criminal than for many conſpiring into a Common-wealth, to change both Perſon and Government from the Natural to the Artificial, and meerly of Humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Now that Poſſeſſion doth not alwayes include a Title, nor Might, Right, in Civil Affairs, is both moſt reaſonable and Chriſtian to believe. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable from ſeveral heads: Firſt, from the notoriouſneſs of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which croud in upon all Societies of Men, where this Tenet is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For what a powerful motive will it be to all diſcontented perſons to invade others and diſpoſſeſs them, when there lies no other difficulty before them, but the means to attach ſucceſsfully, whom they intend to deſtroy; but having overcome that, by whatever vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, they ſhall be reputed as legal owners of what they are become Maſters, as the moſt innocent and juſt perſon of all. But can ever any peace, or ſecurity be expected by that Society wherein it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man to intrude himſelf into Power? No, ſay ſome, Power acquired and poſſeſſed doth give Right to hold, but not juſtifie the Act of inordinate acquiring the ſame: But if it be true in Logick, That the Concluſion doth alwayes partake of the weakneſs of the Premiſſes: and in Nature, That an evil cauſe, be it but of the nature of a Circumſtance, corrupteth the whole effect, is it not altogether as rational, that ſuch an hainous act in the acquiring ſuch Power here, ſhould quite marr the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one;</hi> ſaith holy<note place="margin">Job 14. 4. <hi>Recte factum eſt ut id quod male caeptum eſt Autoritate publica deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretur.</hi> Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

Neither can the inveterateneſs of an Evil any wayes mitigate the ſame; nor tract of time wipe away that Guilt which was at firſt acquired: For preſcription in ſuch caſes never gives juſt Title, but where other Titles are extinguiſhed, which is by accident. Then indeed Poſſeſſion it ſelf giveth not a good Title, but hath leſs evil and inconvenience than that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which hath neither one, nor other.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From whence comes the difference made between private ſpoils and robberies, and publick; that the one ſhould once and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remain unjuſt, the other not? This would be known.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, How irrational and intolerable muſt that Dogme be which degradeth humane order and claims, into them, of beaſts and reaſonleſs Creatures? Is it not to be ſuppoſed by all pretenders to Reaſon, That Reaſon is the proper and noble principle of man, whereby he is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from meer Animals? And can any man find a more ſound princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or more eſſential to humane Society, than Juſtice? Now if Title or Right to a thing be the ſame with poſeſſion and never fails to ſucceed upon that; what advantage hath man above beaſt in his acquiſitions? Or what reaſon hath not a beaſt to endeavour to make prey of all he can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Indeed he hath much more reaſon than man acting after this manner, ſeeing he doth proceed therein according to that Law of natural inſtinct and impulſe given unto him, and hath no more ſuperiour principle than ſelf-preſervation to direct him otherwiſe: but man hath; and therefore neglecting, or contemning that for advantage unneceſſary, becomes more vile and brutiſh in his doings than beaſts themſelves, to whom it is as natural to live one upon another, as for men to live in Society under the direction of reaſon, and protection of common Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55232:74"/>Fourthly, Humane and Civil Society require ſome Rule according to which it ought to be framed and adminiſtred. Now either this Rule can be known, or it cannot be known: If it cannot be known, it is all one as if it were not extant at all, becauſe that which is unknown cannot poſſibly have any influence upon a man: But if this rule of humane life and actions is only in power, and no eſtabliſht right of Juſtice, it muſt of neceſſity vary according to might and ſtrength in the poſſeſſour of Dominion: which being uncertain, and every day almoſt changing, a man ſhould ſtand obliged to accommodate his obedience anſwerable to the degrees of Power, and ſo ſometimes ſhould be bound to give obedience to the fourth degree, which we here ſuppoſe to be the higheſt, ſometimes to a third, ſometimes to the ſecond, and ſometimes to one onely, and theſe degrees being abſurd and obſcure to him, he muſt of neceſſity be perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and undetermined in his reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To add no more, the inverting of the argument brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fixt obedience upon the ſcore of Juſtice, from Gods omnipotence over the Creature, makes much more againſt mutable obedience. For whereas it is ſuppoſed (not at all ſo much as offered to be proved) that the ground of our obedience to God is laid in his Omnipotence, and we are bound to ſerve and obey him becauſe we cannot otherwiſe chooſe; This is groſly falſe: For though God be of ſuch infinite and abſolute power as he could compel us to obedience, even againſt our reſolutions and will, yet in truth he doth not, but, as is apparent, leaves us at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty either to obey, or rebel againſt him. And if obedience were only due where power conſtrains, or fear of evil impels a man; then where no actual force were upon a man, and where he could carry his offence ſo well that he feared no evil, there he owed no actual obedience becauſe as the habit of Authority doth anſwer the habitude of obeying, ſo the act of obeying muſt anſwer the act of power; which being not exerciſed, neither ſhould it be needful to exerciſe any act of obeying. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Power in God doth not properly or immediately entitle him to the ſervice and worſhip of the Creature. For though all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed originally from the power of God, yet from his good-will and pleaſure actuating his remoter power, do all things take their being and ſubſiſtance, and proviſion immediately; and therefore from hence much rather than from that, are we to take an eſtimate of our obedience; and where brutality and monſtrouſneſs have not ſo far confounded and debauched mens underſtandings, as to deny themſelves to be men (which they do who deſtroy all principles of knowing and doing) this muſt be received as a ſure ground; <hi>viz.</hi> That every man muſt have his due, and his due is his own, and therefore our very beings proceeding from God, our preſervation and proviſion being the effect of his good Providence towards us, if there be any reaſon of mens actions in the world, this muſt of neceſſity be ſuch, that what we have received of God, we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be received of him; and apparent Juſtice (more than Power) requires we ſhould return God his own, ſo far as we are able: Now our very <hi>beings</hi> we cannot without violation of his will, who gave them to continue according to his will, not our own: Therefore ſo far as we can, we are bound to a recognition of him, out of Juſtice, were there no ſuch thing as power to conſtrain us; or elſe we ſhould do him<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <argument>
                        <p> An Application of the former Diſcourſe of Civil Government to Eccleſiaſtical. How Chriſts Church is alwayes viſible, and how inviſible. Of the Communion of Chriſt and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Church of Chriſt taken ſpecially for the Elect, who ſhall infallibly be ſaved, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver viſible. But taken for true Profeſſours of the Faith, muſt alwayes be viſible, though not Conſpicuous, in compariſon of other Religions or Hereſies.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Reaſons moving me to inſiſt a while upon Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, before I entred upon Eccleſiaſtical, are, Firſt, becauſe I find Authors of the grounds of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to treat of the ſame, generally. Secondly, becauſe, where breaches have been made often in the Faith and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church; there, neceſſary proviſion ought to be made to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them for the future; but for want of due underſtanding of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, licencious zeal blinded with preſumption hath tranſported very many into unchriſtian practiſes. Thirdly, becauſe it is a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the more clear and compendious purſuing of our ſubject of the Spiritual Society of the Church of Chriſt, and particularly its Form.</p>
                     <p>The Form of Chriſts Church may be diſtinguiſhed according to the vulgar Notion, into inviſible and viſible; or inward and outward. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible we here call that which doth not at all offer it ſelf to our outward ſenſe of ſeeing, cannot be beholden with our eye: Or that which may in ſome manner appear to our ſight, but not as a Church of Chriſt, though in truth it ſo may be. According to the firſt acceptation of inviſible, we underſtand the Body Myſtical of Chriſt, conſiſting of himſelf the only proper Head, the Holy Spirit animating and influencing the ſame, and the particular members of the holy, moſt happy inviſible Spirits in heaven, and Saints on earth ſpiritually united to them by Chriſt in the divine band of holineſs. And hitherto do the words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> ſeem to be applyed; ſaying, <hi>Having made known the myſtery of his will—That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth, even in him:</hi> ſignifying hereby the myſtical conjunction of Men and Angels in Chriſt Jeſus: although there are who not improbably and more literally do underſtand theſe words only of the collection and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Jews, (who in reſpect of their peculiar exaltation to Gods ſervice
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55232:75"/>
and favour, are ſtiled in Scripture <hi>heavenly</hi> compared with the Gentiles) and Gentiles into one Faith, and Church of Chriſt, which therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times is called a Myſtery, as <hi>Romans</hi> the 16. 25, 26. <hi>Epheſ. 3. v. 3, 4, 5. Col. 1. 26, 27. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. becauſe, as is there expreſſed, it was an hidden and incredible thing to the Jews, that the Gentiles ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the like priviledges and rights of ſerving God, as were once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed incommunicable to any ſo fully as to the Jews. But whether the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, according to its moſt genuine and literal ſenſe, intendeth at any time to comprehend into one Society, Angelical Peings, and Humane, as the Church of Chriſt, as I do not find (though the Ancients as well as Modern have held ſuch an opinion) ſo do I not oppoſe; the Myſtery of which we now ſpeak being ſufficiently verified in the preternatural and inviſible conjunction of Chriſt and his Church, in the indiſſoluble bands of his Spirit, guiding the members thereof into all ſufficiencie of Grace here, and immortal abſolute glory hereafter in heaven.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand this co-union or conjunction of Chriſt and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the better, we are to call to mind a threefold union intimated in holy Writ unto us. Firſt a conjunction of Nature when more are of the ſame individual nature: as the three Perſons in the Holy Trinity are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in the ſame Divine Nature, though in themſelves diſtinct; which is ſo proper to that myſtery of the Trinity, that it is not to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, no not in that intimate communion we now ſpeak of, between Chriſt and his Members, their natures continuing diſtinct. Again, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conjunction proper to Chriſtian Religion is the union of two natures into one Perſon; as in the Myſtery of Chriſts incarnation, when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and divine Nature become one, ſo far as to conſtitute but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Chriſt Jeſus: So do not Chriſt and his Church. But by a third way are Chriſt and his Church united into one aggregate Spiritual Body or Society; which is effected by his Spirit, which yet do not make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Part of that Body, but by its manifold divine Graces do produce and conſerve the ſame: Chriſt thereby and his Church being, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>One Spirit. He that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> And<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe ſaith, <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This truly, and only in a proper ſenſe is inviſible, and that alwayes: and hath two Parts, the triumphant in Heaven, which is a moſt perfect, pure, holy, and bleſſed Society which have through the bloud of the Lamb and the power of his Spirit, overcome the three grand Enemies, Sin, Death, and the Devil, and reaped the fruits of their ſufferings and labours; all tears being wiped from their eyes, all ſorrows being fled away, all temptations for ever conquered, and ceaſing to moleſt them. Now this part of Chriſt's Church remains alwayes <hi>invoſible</hi> unto us here below.</p>
                     <p>And as for the other Part which is called Militant, and are deſcribed to be <hi>A number of faithful and elect people living under the Croſs, and aſpiring towards the perfection of Grace and Glory hereafter, ſuppoſing at preſent what may hereafter be farther diſcuſsed; viz.</hi> That ſuch a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar number of holy perſons there are within the viſible Church of Chriſt, which ſhall infallibly attain to everlaſting bliſs in heaven; yet neither are theſe, as ſuch, at any time viſible or diſcernable to our common ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. It being ſcarce, if at all, poſſible to judge infallibly who ſhall be ſaved, and who ſhall not be ſaved: it being much more difficult
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55232:76"/>
for any man to be aſſured of another mans ſalvation, than of his own: ſeeing that, as is ſaid, hereunto an inward teſtimony of Gods Spirit is required, which is the ground of that ſound hope which is commonly called Aſſurance; but the Promiſes of God in holy Scripture do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in like manner to the aſſuring of any man that another ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as that he himſelf ſhall; or that anothers faith ſhall not fail as that his own ſhall not; but thus far only probably a truer and more certain ſentence may be pronounced by others, who are ordained of God to be judges of our ſtate of Grace, upon the diſcovery of our conſciences to them, then can be by our ſelves; which is ſufficient: but of the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terableneſs of that ſtate no man can certainly affirm any thing. Which holdeth true likewiſe as to the contrary ſtate of Damnation. For though a more than probable judgment may be made of the ſtate of Damnation of him who continues impenitently in notorious ſins, yet may no man pronounce a peremptory ſentence againſt any ſuch perſon, that he ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ſhall be damn'd; becauſe he cannot ſee into the abſtruſe Counſels of Almighty God ſo far, as to deny a Liberty left in him to confer ſuch efficacious grace upon ſuch a notorious offender as may reduce him to God; no more than withdraw grace from him who at preſent ſtandeth in all probable way of perſeverance.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo, it followeth from hence neceſſarily, That the Church of Chriſt, taken for the ſo faithful and elect, that they ſhall without all peradventure attain the Crown of the Triumphant, is, evermore in its own nature, inviſible, that is, not to be diſtinguiſhed by us, nor known cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; and if ſo, then in vain and to no purpoſe at all are ſuch Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as are made about the inviſible Church, in that ſenſe of inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which ſignifies that which can in no manner appear certainly to us.</p>
                     <p>The other ſenſe of inviſibleneſs, according to which a thing is poſſible to be ſeen, is an object of ſenſe, but actually is either not to be ſeen, or with very great difficulty. For as in Philoſophy, it is with <hi>Diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> ſo may it be with <hi>Viſibility</hi> in Divinity. Every thing that hath Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, according to the Philoſopher, is diviſible or is capable of being divided into leſſer parts, even without end: but yet ſo ſmall may the parts ſo divided become at laſt, that no Artiſt ſhall be able to cut them any more in pieces. So may we underſtand a thing to be <hi>viſible,</hi> which is ſo ſmall and inconſiderable, that actually it can hardly, if at all, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: But viſible and palpable being taken for things which not only affect the ſenſes ſimply, but with ſome more than common notoriety; the uſual queſtion, Whether the Church of Chriſt is alwayes viſible, ought to be underſtood of ſuch a competence of perſpicuity as may ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily be diſcerned by perſons rightly diſpoſed in their underſtandings; taking here, <hi>right diſpoſition</hi> of our inward apprehenſions, in a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable manner to that which relates to our common outward ſenſes; which if it be called into doubt, (as it may) no wonder that the other may be, and that without remedy.</p>
                     <p>Now according to the moſt ſtrict acceptation of <hi>Viſible,</hi> for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may poſſibly be diſcerned, the reaſolution will be eaſie, That Chriſts Church is, and muſt alwayes be viſible: For thus to be Inviſible, is as much as not to be at all. For ſeeing the Parts of which it conſiſts (be they but two or three perſons in the moſt rigorous ſenſe) are Viſible, the whole muſt needs be viſible too, of it ſelf: however it may in the more
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55232:76"/>
received ſenſe be termed inviſible, becauſe compared with the Church of Chriſt, as propheſied of, and promiſed in the Goſpel, it is ſo inconſiderable, as may deſerve rather to be accounted inviſible, it being out-ſhined, and over-ſhadowed by other Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p>But there being two things which conſtitute the Church; one, the aſſociation of many perſons into outward communion one with another: the other the inward communion in the true Faith of Chriſt: and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being common very often to Hereticks, as well as true Chriſtians, it may be doubted, whether the true Church of Chriſt, as oppoſed to heretical Societies is at all viſible? For ſeeing the true and orthodox Faith, together with its practical holineſs, do not occur plainly to our ſenſes, the true Faith cannot be diſcerned viſibly from the falſe, by any outward ſenſe: How can it poſſibly be ſaid, that the Church of Chriſt is at all viſible or apparent to a man? 'Tis true, a man may diſcern a real man from a painted man, or from any other creature from the outward notices of his body, though he cannot ſee his ſoul, which doth primarily conſtitute the perſon of man; but he cannot ſee whether he be a true and honeſt man in a moral ſenſe, from any thing appearing outwardly. So may one diſcern the Faith profeſſed in general to be Chriſtian, by the outward frame and faſhion of the Church profeſſing the ſame: but the ſoundneſs of the ſame, and ſincerity according to Chriſts will and inſtitution, he cannot from thence conclude upon. And therefore, if the Catholick Faith, as Catholick (in the ſtricter ſenſe) can never be viſible; the Catholick Church ſo being and denominated from that Faith, can never be ſaid to be properly viſible, but only as a Society, not as the true Society of Chriſtians in oppoſition to the falſe. For inſtance, ſenſe or common reaſon not informed from the word of God, could never judge whether the <hi>Arrian</hi> or the Catholick Faith (as it then began to be called) were moſt truly Chriſtian: but they both might judge that they were Chriſtian Societies, and ſo at leaſt outwardly, made a true Church. But becauſe it is one thing to profeſs the true Faith; and another quite diſtinct from that, Truly to profeſs the Faith, as it is one thing to profeſs Juſtice and Truth and Honeſty, and another truly to profeſs theſe and practiſe them, therefore can there be no eſtimate taken of the true Catholick Church from the perſons profeſſing the Catholick Faith, who are alwayes uncertain and mutable, but judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be made from the outward conſtitution only, which are Diſcipline or Government, and not Doctrine or Faith. For where the former is not rightly compoſed according to the mind and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, there cannot be ſaid to be a true Church. And where the ſecond is wanting, there muſt likewiſe be no Church, the foundation of the Church and Rule failing; <hi>viz.</hi> the true Faith. But wherever theſe be inviolately and incorruptly preſerved, and publickly profeſſed, though we ſhould ſuppoſe every particular Member of ſuch a Society to be notorious Hypocrites, yet the Church might be ſaid to be a true Church: becauſe the Church doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any more than its material ſubſiſtance from the perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: but its formal and more diſtinct Being it hath from the true Regiment and Faith, which it is poſſible, though ſcarce probable, may be ſufficiently preſerved under hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and wicked members of the ſame. This is not only true
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55232:77"/>
in it ſelf, but appears ſo to be from the neceſſity of having any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Church at all; and its being viſible at any time. For it never being certainly viſible who are the predeſtinate infallibly to Life, and who are not; who ſhall conſtantly ſtand, and who ſhall fall; who are inwardly hypocrites, and who are faithful and ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (ſeeing notwithſtanding the exacteſt judgment and ſearch of man, there may be a falling away:) It could never appear which is the true Church, if judgment were to be made not from the outward Forms and Faith profeſſed, but from the affection and inclination of Perſons: or from the inviſible decrees of God, of granting or denying perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Grace to perſons in the Church. So that it is manifeſt from hence, how lurious, frivolous, vain, and ſophiſtical diſquiſitions muſt needs be, which are founded and managed upon the ground of an inviſible Church properly ſo called.</p>
                     <p>The improper acceptation then of <hi>Inviſible</hi> can only occaſion a juſt controverſie: <hi>i. e.</hi> as it is taken comparatively, and in relation to a much more conſpicuous and glorious Society; and that either of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels who may by numbers much exceed in outward glory much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine it, in power over-rule it; and by perſecution and oppreſſion ſo far ſtraiten, leſſen, and cruſh it, that it may be termed obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. Or otherwiſe compared with the Societies of much more publick and outwardly glorious Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, pretending the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
                     <p>And truly, if acute and exact Geographers computing the ſeveral profeſſions of Religion, and their poſſeſſions of the earth, deceive us not, the Church of Chriſt may comparatively with other ſuperſtitions Mahometan, Jewiſh and Gentile, be not unaptly ſaid to be inviſible: Chriſtian Religion being allowed but Five parts of Thirty, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſix, and Idolaters nineteen parts of the earth. But if we ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Chriſtian again into Catholick, according to the Judgment of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">See <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Chap. 14.</note> Writers, there will not remain at preſent above two parts of all the Thirty parts of the earth to be poſſeſſed by the Catholicks: and if ſo, what will become of the viſibility of the Church, thus underſtood? And if a moderate ſenſe of viſibility be admitted, ſignifying a real and apparent being only of the Church, though inferiour in pomp and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unto others, how doth the great end and benefit for which chiefly the Church is to be maintained Catholick and Viſible, ſhrink up into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing, when it cannot commend it ſelf, for any ſuch glory to the beholder, nor ſignalize it ſelf to the doubter of the true Faith in the Church? as may hereafter appear more fully when we ſhall come to ſpeak of the Notes of the Church: It may ſuffice to conclude this Point with theſe two:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Chriſts Church is eſſentially, and ſo long as it is at all, muſt neceſſarily be a Society or a communion of many. For ſo we are taught to believe out of the Apoſtles Creed: which ſpeaking of the Catholick Church, exegetically interpreteth what we are to underſtand by that term: <hi>viz. The Communion of Saints.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to diſtinguiſh between being of the [Catholick] Church, and being Chriſtians. A man may be a Chriſtian, and yet not be of the Church: For no man can be of the Church who doth not hold communion with it. For to deceive himſelf, and ſay, though he be not of the viſible Communion or viſible Church, he may be,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55232:77"/>
or is of the inviſible and myſtical, is to take for granted that which he ought to prove, but never can be able, but from ſomewhat external; and the ordinary method and moſt effectual means of being myſtically united unto Chriſt, is by being Politically united (which muſt be viſibly) unto the Body of Chriſt, the Church. It hath been therefore ever matter of greateſt wonder to me, to hear, and read how freely all ſtruglers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Chriſtians (how inconſiderable ſoever) do aſſert to, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to aſſert that common Rule, <hi>Without the Church there is no ſalvation,</hi> and are ſo obſcure, nice or abſurd in their ſenſe of it: having very little or nothing to ſecure themſelves from ſelf-condemnation, beſides an ill grounded preſumption that they are inwardly united to Chriſt, and are of the inviſible Church; which in truth is no Church: but a certain ſtate wherein there is no adminiſtration or order, that we can learn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now all Society muſt neceſſarily have order and adminiſtrations for their regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but none ſuch do we read of to be in Chriſts inviſible Body, Chriſt himſelf being all in all; and therefore improperly called a Church. And therefore all ſuch being infallibly ſaved who are ſo of Chriſts Body: they that ſo abruptly and peremptorily aſſure themſelves they are of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible State, do in effect contradict themſelves, and mean they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without being of the Church: For ſurely the Authour of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meant nothing elſe, but that before one could be (according to Gods ordinary diſpenſation revealed in his word) of Chriſts myſtical Body, called abuſively the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> he muſt belong to the viſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſts Political Body or Church. So that it is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficient to comfort our ſelves with an opinion that we are good Chriſtians, and hold the ſame Faith entirely and purely, that is required of us, unleſs we hold outward communion.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, ſecondly, as Chriſts Church muſt neceſſarily be a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty communicating, ſo muſt it be a viſible communion, and outward. For how is it poſſible that ſuch communion which conſtitutes a Society, ſhould be entred into, unleſs it be viſible? There ſhall therefore, as well out of the very nature of the Deſign God and Chriſt had to eſtabliſh a Church, as from the many promiſes fortifying that Reſolution, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that Deſign, be evermore an outward viſible company of Profeſſours of Chriſtian Religion in the world, which ſhall retain the Faith of Chriſt, and the neceſſary effects of it in Worſhip, to that degree of perfection, which ſhall, or may lead a Believer certainly to Salvation, as will more plainly appear from what is now to ſucceed; <hi>viz.</hi> the outward Form of the Church.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the Outward and Viſible Form of Chriſts Church: Chriſt ordained One particularly. What that was in the Apoſtles dayes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after. The vanity of ſuch places of Scripture as are pretended againſt the Paternal Government of the Church.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR the Church to <hi>be,</hi> and to be <hi>viſible,</hi> or appear to <hi>be,</hi> I reckon the ſame thing: and therefore thought good to ſpeak of that, and premiſe it to what in order follows on this ſubject: <hi>viz.</hi> The Viſible Form 2. The Adjuncts or Affections: And 3. the Power of the Church of Chriſt. By the Form of the Church we mean that frame and outward conſtitution, whereby the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtian believers are not only united myſtically and inwardly to Chriſt, as their proper Head, and univerſal, nor as agreeing in the ſubſtance of one Faith and Worſhip, but as conventing and conſenting in one outward <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> or Adminiſtration of this Body ſo collected. So that Diſcipline, otherwiſe called Government, is, by principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries themſelves, rightly affirmed to be an eſſential ingredient into the nature of a Church: which will manifeſtly appear if we diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nature of a Chriſtian, or many Chriſtians ſeparate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from any Juriſdiction, and the nature of a Church. For a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or a true Believer, differeth from a Church, in two things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally: Firſt in the matter. The material part of a believer, as he is a Chriſtian, (not as he is a man) is his Faith, conſiſting of its ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Branches. But the matter of the Church is the Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereof it conſiſteth. Secondly, they differ in their Form too: For no man is properly a Chriſtian, though he believes all the Articles of a Chriſtian, and lives accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs he be formed and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Formale autem Eccleſiae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio fi dei Chriſti int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> by the Sacrament of Regeneration, which is Baptiſm. But the Form of Chriſts Church doth conſiſt in that outward diſpoſition and order of Superiour and Inferiour communicating mutually in all Chriſtian Acts and Offices neceſſary to the conſervation of the whole Body; and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and encreaſe of every Member thereof. This Deſcription of Chriſts Church is warranted us from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> who expreſly maketh <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4. 15, 16. Coloſ. 2. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt the Head of his Church. From whom the whole Body fitly joyned together and compacted, by that which every joynt ſupplyeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the effectual working in the meaſure of every Part, maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Body, unto the edifying its ſelf in Love.</hi> The like words to which we find to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> chap. 2. 19.</p>
                     <p>It muſt therefore from hence be granted, That there is to be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Chriſts Church: and that the Government ought to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55232:78"/>
to the Body thereby ordered and ruled. To the Internal Body of Chriſt, or Myſtical Church not viſible to us, an Internal, Myſtical, and Inviſible adminiſtration, is very agreeable and ſufficient from Chriſt the Head, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit: but the external Church ſtandeth in need neceſſarily of external Rule and Direction, as much as it doth of external Doctrine, Inſtructions and Sacraments, though it be inwardly informed by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be enquired what that Government is whereby Chriſt would have his Church directed, (which is the moſt famous Queſtion of late dayes, though ſcarce ever call'd in queſtion for ſome hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt) the reſolution will be facilitated from what we delivered concerning Government civil. For firſt, if Government Eccleſiaſtical be ſo eſſential to the ſubſiſtence of a Church, that without it, it cannot be of any continuance, without a Miracle; it cannot be imagined with any probability of Reaſon, that God or Chriſt ſhould make one part of his Church; and leave it to the liberty and pleaſure of Man to make the other: but leaſt of all can they be of this opinion, who think ſo ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all Eccleſiaſtical Orders, that to admit any of humane invention or prudence, is to prophane the whole Syſteme. Again, upon the grounds laid down in civil Government: If Chriſt be the Author of Government Eccleſiaſtical in General, he muſt alſo be the Cauſe of ſome one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Particular, otherwiſe he could not be the Authour of any at all: ſeeing Inſtitution Political, as well as Creation Natural, muſt of neceſſity have ſome Object to terminate it, as its effect: Generals, in all caſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars, in the things themſelves: though the way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or learning theſe things, is to begin with the General, and ſo to deſcend to Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to underſtand what kind of Government Chriſt inſtituted in his Church, what more certain and compendious way, what more equal, than to judge rather from matter of Fact, than long and uncertain Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations built on Arguments which are ſubject to diverſe caſualties from mans Paſſion, and Intereſts proſecuted thereby: whereas there is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſufficient from the thing it ſelf, to ſettle belief in that Point.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we are here to note, That when we ſpeak of Government, we intend not to comprehend therein all Accruments, Ornaments or Additions, which happened after the thing it ſelf: For theſe may be, and doubtleſs oftentimes have been the effects of humane Prudence, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by general Precepts: but we ſpeak of the Form it ſelf, or the Kind of Government: For though we ſaid, God was the Author of All well grounded Government, and do not mean, that every particle thereof, or inferiour, additional Grace muſt proceed from the ſame hand: For God having permitted, if not ordered, that every nation ſhould conform it ſelf in outward matters, to the condition of the time and place; God muſt have made for ſeveral Ages and ſeveral Places, ſeveral Regiments, which no man hath preſumed to affirm; the Divine Right or Inſtitution extending only to thoſe things, wherein all at firſt agreed. So that as children receive from the Nature of man, at firſt created by God in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> their fouls and bodily ſhape, with the ſeveral parts neceſſarily thereunto belonging; but their behaviours, geſtures, gates, favour and complexions are commonly derived from their immediate Pare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s. So doth every true Body of Chriſt, every Church, receive common forms
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55232:79"/>
and ſhapes from the firſt Inſtitution of Chriſt extant in the Primitive times, but their particular modifications and cuſtomes are owing to to their Spiritual Fathers, whether mediate or immediate. Which frowardly and peeviſhly to reject, or diſobediently to oppoſe, without higher warrant, what is it elſe but to imitate ſuch graceleſs and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral children who are aſhamed of their own Parents?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A diſtinction ought to be put between the nature and degrees of any thing, and eſpecially of the Church; which had its conception in the womb of the Jewiſh Church; its infancy, during our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours<note place="margin">Tum maxime Deus ex memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria hominum labitur, cum beneficiis ejus fruentes hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem dare divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae indulgentiae deberent. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius lib. 2. cap. 1. de Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Erroris.</hi>

We are not then to be ſo narrow in our judgment of the Churches ſtate, to allow no more to it then when it but juſt crept out of the womb, or when, having gathered a little ſtrength, it could ſtand alone, but not act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prime Inſtitutours intention; but as it was habited and affected in its riper years, when we may behold that in more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous manner, which at firſt was obſcurer, yet eſſentially the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For as nothing is more evident to all, but ſuch as reſolve they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing that they diſlike, than that, in nature, the Father is made before the children, and not the children before the Parents; ſo is it as plain, according to the courſe of Chriſts Church, and the hiſtory of the Scriptures, that the people at the firſt did no more make or appoint their Government, or Governours in Chriſt, than they did teach or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them: For by the word of God were Chriſtians at firſt begotten to<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15. Philem. 10.</note> a new and ſpiritual life.</p>
                     <p>The method which Chriſt uſed in procreating and proſecuting his Church, is therefore thus made plain: Firſt he himſelf, as the Father and Head of us all under God immediately, (according to that of St. <hi>Paul, The</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor: 11. 3. Epheſ. 5. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Head of every man is Chriſt, and the head of the woman is the man, and the Head of Chriſt is God</hi>) did by his divine Doctrine and Miracles beget unto himſelf his twelve Apoſtles, his children: theſe being firſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by Chriſt unto a capacity of Fathers alſo, and enabled to multiply into ſpiritual children of Grace; when Chriſt ceaſed viſibly and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally (for he never ceaſes ſpiritually) to aſſiſt and direct his Church, were by him, as ſo many Princes of his Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy, commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned and authorized to dilate the ſame, and amplifie it, according to the Power, Preſcriptions, and Grace given them to that end. And Chriſt foreſeeing his Kingdom to be of that vaſt extent, that it would ſurpaſs the ſtrength and ability of any one man to adminiſter the whole, did not leave any Delegate ſo plenarily endued with Power Eccleſiaſtical, as that all ſhould derive from him, as they did from himſelf: For then it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by ſome Act of Chriſt, and ſome inſtance in them, in their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſubordinate power from that eminent Perſon, during his abode on earth, which could have been no more derogative from Chriſt, than it is thought to be now by any. But the Twelve were alike called by Chriſt immediately, and not the leaſt intimation of any prae-eminence, unleſs in order, which cannot be avoided, where there is found never ſo great and juſt equality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55232:79"/>Now becauſe they were rather inhabitude and Right, than Act, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Fathers of the Church, and the whole Earth was to be their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, therefore it behoved and was moſt juſt that they ſhould ſet in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-councel together touching the general deſign of reducing the whole World to the knowledge and obedience of Chriſt: as we read they did in the Second to the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in the Fifteenth, and elſewhere. But being enjoyned to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and every one to betake himſelf to ſuch peculiar Quarters of the World as fell to them by Gods Providence and Aſſignation, it was no longer ſo abſolutely neceſſary to hold aſſemblies for the ſpecial management of each ones proper Cure, but full power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in every Apoſtle of Chriſt, and accordingly was by them exerted, to ordain matters neceſſary to the Flock collected by them. So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what was of publick concernment to the whole, fell under the cognizance of all the Apoſtles, as Peers of Chriſts Kingdom, yet were limited Diſtricts or Dioceſſes diſpoſed of by the councel and authority of one preſiding there. And if there were called more to conſult of that portion of the Church, it was rather of humane reaſon, than divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. For it was ever far from Gods intention in appointing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Methods and Rules for his Church, utterly to extinguiſh or evacuate humane Reaſon: which his own hand had planted in mans ſoul before; but it was to be ſubject to the Superiour Law given by him, and where that which was never intended to be of that unneceſſary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe latitude as to take in all contingencies, preſcribed not otherwiſe, Gods will, we may be ſure it was, that that other help of reaſon ſhould not be denyed its office, and right of miniſtring to our uſes. And what is more agreeable to reaſon, then, That <hi>In the multitude of counſels there is</hi>

                     <p>But I am far from diſputing or arguing this Queſtion any farther than the ground I have laid already will allow, and that is only, to enquire after matter of Fact in the Government of Chriſts Church; thinking it moſt reaſonable and pious to conclude that to be the only Divine which Chriſt inſtituted, and that Chriſt only inſtituted that, which only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World at his being upon earth, and his Apoſtles after him: who, though they brought not Eccleſiaſtical Government to that viſible Form and Order as it afterwards ſhewed it ſelf in, to the world; increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the number, and magnificence of profeſſours of Chriſt; yet gave the Idea and Patern in all the main ſubſtantial parts of it. For, <hi>as the Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Chriſt faith<note place="margin">John 20. 21.</note> not to any one of his Diſciples, <hi>So ſend I thee:</hi> for then it might have been underſtood ſo as if he had endowed ſome ſingle perſon with ſuch a plenitude of power, whereby he might ſucceed him in preſiding over all his other Diſciples, and conſequently over the univerſal Church: but <hi>ſo ſend I you:</hi> ſignifying the imparting of his abſolute and entire power unto all his Apoſtles, ſo far as might conſiſt with the co-ordination founded amongſt them, and conduce to the benefit of the future Church: Between Chriſt then and his Apoſtles, there was a likeneſs, but no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or equality of power: Between the Apoſtles themſelves, there was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55232:80"/>
an equality: But upon the raiſing of a Church, and multiplying of Chriſtians immediately ſprang up diſcrimination of Perſons and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Body of the Church. Neither can any argue from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſts Apoſtles, that there ought to be a Parity alſo among all that ſucceed in the Miniſterial Office, any more than, that this Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould extend it ſelf to the whole Body of the Church: For ſo it was with the Church firſt of all; not only all the Miniſters, but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were equal.</p>
                     <p>And whether it were ſimple neceſſity, or humane prudence, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration, that firſt moved the Apoſtles to limit that General Right, which Chriſt had given them indefinitely to Go and teach all Nations; and each of them to be univerſal Paſtours, in aſſuming to themſelves the ſpecial care and tuition of ſome one place, Province, or Country, it matters not much to enquire. For the ſuppoſition which ſome make of an Obligation upon every Apoſtle to keep himſelf ſo ſtrictly unto the commiſſion of Chriſt, empowring him to miniſter to all Nations, that it was not lawful for him, of himſelf, nor by general and mutual coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and conſent amongſt themſelves, to be determined to any one Province or Nation, is very groundleſs and injurious to the whole deſign Chriſt had in propagating the Faith. For the ſaid commiſſion of Chriſt given to his Apoſtles was not <hi>Lex</hi> but <hi>Jus:</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> to Act, not a <hi>Precept</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably enjoyning the execution according to the full extent of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Again, It was not ſaid to each ſingly, <hi>Go and teach all nations:</hi> but to all conjoyntly. So that to all it was a direct Precept which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, if all Nations were by all the Apoſtles, not all by each of them inſtructed in Chriſt. But the interpretation which taks <hi>All nations</hi> to be rather underſtood negatively in oppoſition to the Jewiſh Church, which enviouſly denyed the like Priviledges of ſalvation to the Gentiles which they claimed proper to themſelves, rather then poſitively, as if by virtue of Chriſts injunction they were neceſſitated to paſs all the world over, (which it is certain that neither any one, nor all ever did; the intention of Chriſt being to open a wide door of Grace to all Nations, ſo far as humane ability could ordinarily promote the work) quite diſables that argument. As it was lawful therefore for all the Apoſtles, and every one of them, to paſs into any Part of the world, ſo was it not unlawful to make choiſe of ſome one conſiderable portion, wherein to move and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate according to his Place. For otherwiſe, how ſhould it be lawful for them to continue in ſome one City two, three, or ſeven years, as 'tis as certain, as any thing in Hiſtory can be, that ſome of them did, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a peculiar and paſtoral care thereof, and its Appendages?</p>
                     <p>Now, becauſe as their Preſence was finite in reference to place, ſo their lives were to time; therefore, when in any one large Province they could not manage immediately themſelves, every City of note and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they aſſigned certain Subſtitutes to continue and promote what they had begun, even during their lives, in many Countries: And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting this life, left them to ſucceed in a perpetual line to all ages; not by intruſion and ſpontaneous invaſion poſſeſſing themſelves of Rule and Authority over others, but according to the ſame form that themſelves were ſent by Chriſt. For Chriſt not only ſent his Apoſtles, but enabled them to ſend others in the like Paſtoral charge. And theſe Apoſtolical Paſtours, together with that perſonal Power given them to be exerciſed by them, had alſo a real paternal Power to conſtitute others of the like, or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55232:80"/>

                     <p>From hence a reaſon may be rendred of the Opinion of ſome very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Bilſon.</note> and learned Defenders of Epiſcopal Government, who ſeeing neither the Apoſtles alone to govern the Church, nor Biſhops alone, have ſaid, It is very hard to determine what was the Diſcipline of the Church in the very Primitive times of all. For ſurely, while the Apoſtles lived, the Government of the Church was Apoſtolical, and not properly Epiſcopal; becauſe thoſe Elders (otherwiſe called Biſhops) ſaid in Scripture to be ſet over Cities, were themſelves wholly at the beck and diſpoſal of the Apoſtles ordaining them, and governed and taught under them: no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than a Prieſt may be under a Biſhop in all ſubjection. But the Apoſtles dying, and their intire power alſo with them, part of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved unto that Perſon, who before in their Right preſided over ſuch a Church, (the Apoſtolicalneſs excepted which conſiſted in an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Ordination to that Office by Chriſt, and illimitedneſs, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof; with other ſignal gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s and graces, not here to be inſiſted on) and was properly Epiſcopal: which conſiſted in an Authority deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Apoſtles, and conſequently from Chriſt, to govern the Church; and not only preſent, for their dayes; but becauſe it was to continue to all Ages, (which it could not without Governours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers) to ordain ſuch who ſhould ordain others without interruption) for ever: And theſe not only ſuch who ſhould ſucceed them in the like Paſtoral care, but who might together with them (though under them) by their counſel and labours, as the common Fathers of the Church, take part of his charge upon them, in teaching and governing ſuch a portion of that Church as was allotted them. And theſe were called Prieſts or Presbyters. And as the Biſhop was conſtrained, Chriſtians multiplying, to ordain an aſſiſtent Presbyter to him, ſo when the People under that Presbyter increaſed ſo far that it was too difficult for him to diſcharge all Offices of publick and private miniſtration, it was found expedient to ordain an inferiour Officer in the Church, to him, for his aſſiſtance, called a Deacon or Miniſter. Not that theſe two laſt Orders themſelves were of humane or moderner Inſtitution than the Apoſtles dayes, but that they might be likewiſe undetermined, in the place of their Function, to any particular Perſon, until the conſummation of the Apoſtolical age: But in truth, it is hard to determine what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture intends ſpeaking of Deacons; and therefore, I offer this mean o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as not inconſiſtent with theirs, who hold them of Apoſtolical Inſtitution; nor with theirs, who make them much later: For the firſt may be true, as to the Office which was a degree Eccleſiaſtical, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth: and the other, as to the manner of exerciſe, in reference to one place, and one preſiding there.</p>
                     <p>And the like ſeems moſt probable concerning the Evangeliſts, who were perſons commiſſioned by the Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel under them, without any determination to a certain place or people; and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this large Licence, were in no higher degree than ſimple Presbyters: the Apoſtles themſelves preſiding in all ſuch places, as Paſtours: But when they were by their farther Authority fixt to one City and Country, with a power to create Succeſſours or Co-adjutors in the Government of that Church, then they became formal and proper Biſhops. For the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55232:81"/>
of them is moſt frivolous, who would elude the expreſs teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture, affirming that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Biſhops, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying <hi>they were Evangeliſts:</hi> For by the ſame reaſon they may deny they were Presbyters, becauſe probably they were Evangeliſts, and ſo make them of no order in the Church, or of another, which is yet unknown to the world: which, whatever it may pleaſe men to call it, certainly it muſt be founded on Prieſtly Power, or elſe they could not have regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted as they did. Neither was it, as ſome may phanſie, to degrade ſuch Evangeliſts whoſe faculty extended to all places, to be confined to one afterward, as Biſhop. Firſt, becauſe ſuch power was more truly indetermined to one, than extending actually to all: For it depended on the pleaſure of the Apoſtles to ſend them to what place they thought fit: Secondly, this fixing of them to one place was not without the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of power of Government, as well as preaching, which is no where found to be in them before; and which doth more than countervail ſuch antecedent liberty of ſimply teaching, as was then in ſome manner fixed. Thirdly, there was in ſuch caſes as this, added a Power and Right of inſtituting others as occaſion offered, which is unknown to have been in them as Evangeliſts.</p>
                     <p>From it follows that of all the forementioned kinds of Government; that of the Church approached neereſt to that call'd Monarchical, which was only abſolute and univerſal in Chriſt, the Soveraign Head thereof; but Miniſterially under him, and over the Church under their circuit Politically, as proper Heads and Rulers: and whatever power (after extraordinary Callings by Revelation from God ceaſed) any one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partake of in the Church, was ctrtainly at firſt derived from ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſons alone, however to the ſolemnity of ſuch ordination others of an inferiour Order concurred thereto. And as the Government of the civil World was originally without exception, ſo far as ſearch can be made by the moſt curious Antiquaries, Monarchical, though it were not governed by one man alone, but by Civil Supream Princes of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dominions, into which the earth was parcelled. So though no one Father or Biſhop ever preſided over all the Chriſtian world, yet ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſingle Perſons in their reſpective Provinces governing the Church as Principal, the Government of the Church may rightly be termed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical in Particular; but Ariſtocratical as to the whole: For as the Apoſtles were all Monarchs compared with their Proſelites, Converts, and Churches by them founded, but were but Peers compared one with another: So was it with the Biſhops and Patriarchs of the Church ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them: whereby the Propheſie of Chriſt in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> was verified, ſpoken not ſo much (as ſome miſtake it) of his Heavenly Kingdome, but earthly, his Church and its enſuing glory. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which</hi>

For as it was not at all the mind of Chriſt that there ſhould be no Governours at all over his Church; ſo doth it not at all appear that what was lawful for many to do, was not lawful for one. But here the old cheat again takes place to ſuppoſe that the Government of one is in it ſelf tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and of many, free: but neither Chriſt nor nature ever taught them how to prove this preſumptuous imagination. And to this may we add another ſuch miſtake from St. <hi>Peters</hi> words, That men ſhould not <hi>be Lords over Gods heritage.</hi> And what then? Muſt there be more<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> than one over a Church, and not onely one? May a company of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters oblige Chriſtians to do, or believe ſuch things, and not <hi>Lord</hi> it, but if by a principal Perſon bearing Rule, this ſame thing be done, then is the Precept violated? Beſides, who ſees not, that hath not a mind to be blind, That the Apoſtle ſpeaks nothing at all in theſe words of the kind of Government, but the exerciſe of it, and abuſe? Surely if Epiſcopal Government could not chooſe but tyrannize, and Presbyterial could do nothing but according to Scripture and equity; this Objection were unanſwerable, otherwiſe not worth the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much leſs anſwering, as common as it is, and as confidently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                     <p>And as to that Pretenſe intended to overthrow our prime ground of Chriſts inſtitution taken from what was firſt actually found in the Church: <hi>viz.</hi> That Imparity of Chriſts Miniſters was not found in the Church till about an hundred and forty or fifty years after Chriſt (when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Enemies of Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchies, that it prevailed.) Let the Huggers of this Device, Firſt conſider what a pitiful addition is made to their cauſe from hence; ſeeing that it is undenyable there was a diſparity all the Apoſtles dayes, who in order excelled all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons; and that almoſt one hundred years were ſpent of the ſaid tearm, in their time: So that about fifty or ſixty years only this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Government had its being, and then was loſt again for fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and then was better loſt then found, and taken up again. But a far worſe inconvenience ſpoils this jeſt, as being founded and raiſed only from conjecture; and that conjecture upon the obſcurity of thoſe ages, not ſo clearly known as afterwards.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the neceſſity of holding viſible Communion with Chriſts Church. Knowledge of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church neceſſary to that Communion. Of the Notes to diſcern the true Church: how far neceſſary. Of the Nature or Condition of ſuch Notes in General.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT being ſo neceſſary (as we have above ſhewed) to be in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the viſible Church of Chriſt, and the Nature of things themſelves being more intrinſick, many times, than to characterize ſufficiently them to the Enquirer into them; it hath been thought neceſſary to explain them farther by more apparent and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble notices given of them. And in the Doctrine of the Church theſe ſeem to be of greateſt conſequence; Viſibility, Univerſality or Catholickneſs, Sanctity and Perpetuity. Of all which we ſhall briefly ſpeak in order: yet firſt premiſing ſomewhat concerning Notes in General.</p>
                     <p>For ſeeing (as we have ſaid) it is neceſſary to know the true Church from the falſe, and the Natures of things are often-times ſo abſtruſe and hidden from us that we cannot diſcover them from their own Light, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath been judged very reaſonable to pitch upon certain outward Notes, eading us unerringly to the knowledge of the thing it ſelf. And in truth, I cannot wholly approve of that courſe choſen to certifie us, and point out to us the-true Church, taken from the very being of it: ſuch as are, <hi>Faithful and ſincere Doctrine taught therein, Sacraments du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred, Worſhip purely performed,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline rightly conſtituted:</hi> becauſe theſe are rather of the very intrinſick nature, and definition it ſelf of the Church, than notes and characters outward, whereby the nature it ſelf ſhould be certainly known. We all, indeed without exception, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that that Church is the true Church, which is thus qualified and affected; believeth aright, is governed aright, adminiſtreth the Sacraments aright, and worſhippeth aright; and in one word, which followeth moſt exactly the Rules of Holy Scripture; but in the Aſſumption and Application is all the doubt, and infinite differences; which of all Pretenders to theſe, are aſſuredly ſo affected, and bleſſed moſt with them. Therefore, theſe are not ſufficient lights and demonſtration of themſelves to us. For we grant readily, That whatever Church hath all them, is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie a true Church of Chriſt; but whether this or that Church pretending to them, hath them really, remains to be enquired into. Hence it hath been judged expedient to repair to ſome more ſenſible and apparent Notes or Indications to certifie us of matter of Fact; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſo it is with this Church, and not with another. And it is well ſaid, That Notes of a thing muſt neceſſarily be diſtinct from the thing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55232:83"/>
they notifie unto us: and that eſpecially in theſe two things. Firſt, in reference to the thing deſcribed, than which they muſt be more evident and apparent: as the argument muſt alwayes be more clear than the thing in Queſtion to be proved therewith. Secondly, in reference to other things, they muſt not be common to more than that thing they are uſed to expreſs and ſignifie: As no man that never ſaw an horſe before, can know it from an Ox, by being told that, an Horſe hath two ears, four legs, and a long tail. And a third note of a true Note may be added, and that is, that it be <hi>inſeparable.</hi> For though no more but one thing has ſuch a mark by which it may be known, yet if that thing be moveable, and not conſtant to it, it cannot at all times be known by it; as the Moon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwayes be diſtinguiſhed and known from other ſtars, from horns or Angles which many times it wants.</p>
                     <p>This ſpeculation is very rational, but yet not exempt altogether from the inconveniencies of the former opinion, it failing little leſs in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and Application of ſuch unfailing Notes as are preſumed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. For thoſe being the very choiceſt of many more Notes mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome for the guiding us to the true Catholick Church, they are either obſcure, or inconſtant and ſeparable, or laſtly common to thoſe Churches not received for pure and Catholick, as will appear by and by: Therefore, I ſuppoſe, a mean opinion may in this caſe be moſt true and ſafe: as that, Firſt, there can be no ſuch infallible outward means of comming to, or diſcerning the true Church from the falſe, as may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any one from errour. For the Propheſies and Promiſes of Chriſt concerning the glory and conſpicuouſneſs of his Church; <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhould be <hi>as a City ſet on a hill:</hi> That it ſhould be the <hi>Light of the world;</hi> That it ſhould be <hi>a Mountain unto which all Nations ſhould flow,</hi> and ſuch like; infer no more than this, That, whereas under the Law the Doors of Chriſts Church were in a manner ſhut againſt the greateſt part of the world; under the Goſpel Chriſt would keep open houſe to all commers: and that it ſhould be more poſſible and eaſie to enter into the communion of his true Flock, than formerly it had been; not that it ſhould not be poſſible to miſtake, but upon affected and wilful ignorance, next to malice. Neither doth there appear any greater reaſon, why any man ſhould be infallible in the choice of the true Church, than when he is in the true Church, that he ſhould be infallible in all points of Faith therein truly profeſſed. In a word, No greater inconvenience doth appear from the want of infallible means to lead men to the true Church, who are in ſight, but not knowledge of it; than to bring Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens into an ordinary capacity of entring into it. A man may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that corrupt and degenerate ſtate he now is in, for want of that grace, he could not of himſelf acquire, and yet God be under no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of injuſtice or tyranny, who gives him no more than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and denyes him no more than he may juſtly detain from him. For the mercy of God exceeds all, not only merit, but admiration that ſo many find the way to the truth; while ſome (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it) are <hi>Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note> But were it ſo, that thoſe means to ſalvation, whether general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, did work naturally, not Evangelically or morally by the co-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutancie of grace accompanying them, and inwardly diſpoſing the mind to aſſent to, and embrace them, then indeed ought there to be certain and infallible cauſes outward to that end; but it is not ſo: for as liberal as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55232:84"/>
God hath ſhewn himſelf in the Goſpel and means outward of attaining to the truth, he keeps the reins ſtill in his own hands, and the key of knowledge by him, the efficacy of the moſt probable means, even that of diſtinguiſhing and knowing the true Church, depending upon his free and inſcrutable Grace; which would in this particular be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and uſeleſs, if certain acceſs might be made unto it by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative notes to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing commending herein a mean opinion, may be the due acknowledgment of the uſe of ſuch outward marks and means guiding us to this prime truth of the Church. For notwithſtanding, we have ſaid the Grace of God hath a main ſtroke in every mans right choice of ſuch dubious undemonſtrable truths, yet doth it not ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr (and we have nothing to know of extraordinary acts of God) but by ſuch ordinary means as he hath inſtituted and tyed us to obſerve, to be capable thereof: and therefore are we to embrace and improve all outward helps which may beſt conduce to that end; otherwiſe we either forfeit or repel ſuch grace from us. And of ſuch means I know none more reaſonable and probable to bring us to the knowledge of this point, then are they above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the uſe of thoſe means or notes upon tryal, will be found to conſiſt not ſo much in the Affirmative, as Negative ſenſe: that is, not characterizing Catholick Churches in oppoſition to Heretical, by being found only in any Church, becauſe they are alſo found in ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Heretical: but being not found in Churches pretending Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſme, ſtigmatizing them for falſe and defective. And truly it is well worth the labour to be informed of errors, as that which prepareth to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it is to be obſerved of the nature of Notes or Properties, that they are either of the whole <hi>Species</hi> or kind, as that given by <hi>Plato</hi> of a Man, That he is <hi>a two-footed creature having no feathers on his body:</hi> or they are Particular, relating to ſome <hi>Individuum</hi> or ſingle one of that kind: as that given of God himſelf to diſtinguiſh <hi>Saul</hi> whom God had<note place="margin">1 Sam. 9. 2. 10. 24</note> deſigned King, from the reſt of the people, from his ſtature, That <hi>he was higher by head and ſhoulders than the reſt of the people.</hi> And thus was <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>Tiſhbite</hi> known to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> That <hi>he was an hairy man, girt with</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Kings 1. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>a girdle of Leather.</hi> Now in this queſtion it is not ſo much enquired into, how abſolutely one man may be known from another; nor how one Church may be diſtinguiſhed from another, as the <hi>Roman</hi> from the <hi>Greek,</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> Church; for this, thought it be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, is ſcarce worth the labour: but the doubt and material difficulty is, How to know which of theſe are Catholick and true Churches of Chriſt, and which are Heretical or Erroneous in any degree? I ſay, the Enquiry is not, which is which Church, as a man might be known to be ſuch an one by name, from his ſtature, his hair or the like: but which of theſe are true and orthodox Churches. This can be by no other notes infallibly, but ſuch as are truly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly proper to true Churches, and are no leſs found in other true Churches than in this. And therefore it is moſt true, what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, That the true Church is known by the true Faith profeſſed, right Diſcipline adminiſtred, and the holy Sacraments duly uſed; but not before it be certainly known that all theſe are actually ſo obſerved, and really not pretendedly only. And ſo is it as true, That, it being
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55232:84"/>
known certainly which is the true Church, it muſt be known likewiſe by neceſſary conſequence, that all theſe three are faithfully obſerved in that Church; which could not be true without them. Now if we firſt muſt judge of Churches by the three General Inſtances and Indications, we muſt firſt judge of theſe Ingredients into its Nature: and before we can do ſo, muſt run through a whole body of Divinity, and that with fallible judgment in the ſearch of it. On the other ſide, if we would know which is the true Religion, from the true Church; to know the true Church firſt, we muſt paſs through infinite Diſputes and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, with the like uncertainty of judging aright as before: and in doing both theſe, we forſake the pretended method of judging by Notes, for we are hereby immers'd in the indagation of the thing it ſelf, without conſideration of Notes: which if they could be had apparently and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, would prevent that long and tedious labour of examining the matter it ſelf. But ſuch (as I have ſaid) I know none poſitive: the neereſt we can come to the point, is Negatively, when there is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting ſuch things as declare at leaſt the unſoundneſs and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Body, ſo defective.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE four principal Notes of the true, or rather falſe Church, not found in it, are <hi>Antiquity, Unity, Succeſſion, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality:</hi> and as moderner Controverters, in <hi>England</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the name of Catholick it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt of theſe we ſay, That her Antiquity is not to be compared with things of quite another nature, but with things of the ſame nature, and comprehended in ſome eminent Period of time. For the Natural worſhip was more ancient than the Moſaical, and the Moſaical than the Chriſtian, in ſuch things wherein they differed. For we have before ſhown, That Chriſtian Religion, according to the material and natural Part of it, which was that connatural light and reaſon ſhining cleerly in the heart of man, and directing him to the belief and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of one God, exceeded in time the Jewiſh worſhip, yet was not to be preferred before it; and the like may be ſaid of the Jewiſh and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. But the enquiry is chiefly about thoſe of the ſame Oeconomy, the ſame profeſſion and denomination. As if it ſhould be demanded, which of the natural Religions were the trueſt? anſwer might well be made, That which was moſt ancient and agreeable to prime Inſtitution. And in like manner, That muſt be the pureſt of the Jewiſh or Moſaical which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

moſt exactly with the moſt ancient and firſt inſtituted, of that kind: and ſo of the Chriſtian undoubtedly; that which retained moſt of the divine Truths and Worſhip, ought to be preferred as the beſt of that kind; as is plain from the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> adviſing that degenerous people and Church thus; <hi>Stand ye in the wayes, and ſee, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi>—Nay, we may extend this to the Mahometan Religion thus far truly; <hi>viz.</hi> to be informed from antiquity, which of all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sects are moſt truly Mahometan, weighing their agreement to, or diſcrepancie from the Inſtitutions of the firſt Author of that Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But here it will be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between things agreeable to the inſtitution, things inſtituted, and things contrary to inſtitution; and that as well for our better ſatisfaction in the following notes, as this preſent: though I confeſs, all this is overthrown if that be taken for granted, which ſome miſchievouſly would obtrude upon the Chriſtian Church in theſe laſt dayes, That nothing, whether intrinſick or extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to Religion it ſelf, in the ſubſtance, muſt be inſtituted but by Chriſt, and ſuch as were divinely inſpired by him: But this at preſent I ſhall take for groundleſs, ſenſleſs, and unpracticable by the Aſſertours and Defenders of it; ſome other place being more proper for its confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this diverſity being allowed, as all reaſon requires, the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this caſe will be much facilitated: For ſurely, that Church (have it never ſo many and fair advantages otherwiſe to commend it to the world) which ſhall either have loſt any material Article of Chriſtian Faith, or notably corrupted and perverted, or introduced any Tenet which is contrary to the firſt Inſtitution, and for which no good ground or reaſon can be alledged out of the all-ſufficient Rule of Faith, muſt needs be falſe: and that no ſuch warrant can be there had, the total ſilence, or contrary Doctrine of the Ages next under the Date of Scriptures (which we here make the Rule) do prove. For where neither the Scriptures moſt ancient expreſſes, or neceſſarily infers any Doctrine of Faith; nor Tradition hath never ſo underſtood the Scriptures, there no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be found upon earth to diſcern truth from falſhood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith from the Spurious and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical. And from this head it was that we find the ancient Fathers to oppoſe and confute the Heretical Inventions and Innovations of men contrary to ſound Faith. For ſuppoſing that Chriſt was the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpenſer of Chriſtian Doctrine, and that he delivered this to the Apoſtles to be farther propagated in the world; what could be ſaid more effectually againſt perverters of the ſame, than to ſhew that ſuch fond and impous tenets as Hereticks obtruded upon the world, could never have Chriſt for their Author, becauſe thoſe who immediately drew from that Fountain, never taught any ſuch thing, but the contrary rather. And that they did not, they proved from inſtances in all the principal Sees of the Apoſtles, and their immediate and following Succeſſors, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delivered any ſuch Doctrine to the world. Upon this Innovating Hereticks were forced to ſeek ſubterfuge from revelations, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſcoveries promiſed (as they corruptly underſtood Scripture) by Chriſt in St. <hi>John,</hi> ſaying; <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye</hi>

not all to his immediate Diſciples, but reſerved diverſe things to be imparted extraordinarily to them: and the phanſie of ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favours from God is ſuch a bewitching device, that few, not ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled in Faith, can choſe but expect and thirſt after, and at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that ſo God doth deal with them, when there is no ſuch matter. And of this Sacrilegious and Heretical folly are thoſe Churches, no leſs than ſimple ſingle perſons, guilty, which under pretenſe of power in the Church (which muſt not be denyed) of declaring the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Faith; do in very deed invent and introduce new Articles of Faith; and abſurd <hi>Scholies</hi> unheard of before, either in ſubſtance or form, and ſay, They do but explain only, what was before implyed and included in holy Writ. For all Articles of Faith, all neceſſary and due Diſcipline, all true Adminiſtration of Sacraments, wherein the truth of Chriſtian Churches are generally affirmed to conſiſt, muſt long ſince have been diſcovered from the Rule of all theſe, or otherwiſe; they, who were ignorant of, or defective in theſe, could not lay any juſt claim to be true Churches of Chriſt. So that in truth, Antiquity thus underſtood is an excellent Note of the true Faith, and the true Faith (not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in worſhip, as is poſſible) more than a Note or Sign of a true Church, it is the very Being it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But where Antiquity it ſelf is obſcure, the condition of a Note (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canvaſers of this point) being to be more cleer than that which is in queſtion, it cannot do this good office for us: And to argue backward, as too many do very incongruouſly, endeavouring to prove that which ſhould prove; is to diſcover the fondneſs of their opinions and falſneſs of their cauſe at the ſame time. For inſtance, to ſay, the Church cannot err in Doctrine, therefore we muſt believe this to be moſt ancient: And to affirm that no man can preciſely declare the time and place when ſuch a Doctrine entred the Church taxed for innovation, is very abſurd as commonly and confidently as it is uſed. For St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> on whoſe grounds they ſeem to build this ſuppoſition; ſuppoſed that Firſt, no time could be inſtanced in, when ſuch an uſance was not in the Church: but many times this can be done againſt pretences to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicalneſs; though the direct time when it began may not be inſtanced in.

Again, it is very weak and frivolous, which is preſumed as unqueſtionable, that all abuſes and corruptions in the Church had ſome proper period wherein they muſt needs ſhow themſelves, according to that formality as afterwards they appeared in, and became notorious. No doubt is to be made, but points of Doctrine had their conceptions, augmentations, and progreſſions inſenſible as infinite other things in nature, and manners have had, and daily have. A man may better demand the hour in which an Apple began firſt to rot, or the week in which an old Groat began firſt to be defaced, and looſe its form, than require a determinate point of time, or perhaps the year in which ſuch a Doctrine began to be corrupted into an heretical ſenſe and practiſe.

For I know nothing properly ſucceeding, but where ſomething is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or loſt. Now the Doctrine of the Church being inceſſant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and not diverſe from it ſelf, cannot be ſaid ſo properly to <hi>ſucceed</hi> it ſelf, as to <hi>perſevere</hi> in the Church. But if we ſhould paſs that order, and allow this language; yet the thing it ſelf ſeems here quite to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: it being not at preſent enquired into the Faith of the Church (which if it were granted to be ſound and Catholick, doth not of it ſelf neceſſarily and fully infer a true Church: and upon the reaſons before agreed to; <hi>viz.</hi> Due adminiſtration of Diſcipline to be eſſential to a true Church) but into the Form conſtituting it a Viſible and Formal Church; to which is indiſpenſably required proper Paſtors, and that by the appointment of Chriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus witneſſeth ſpeaking of Chriſt leaving<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 11, 12</note> the earth, and aſcending into heaven, and deputing thereupon certain Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his ſtead, in a viſible miniſtration, which he ceaſeth now to exerciſe. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers; For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> Now it is not neceſſary here to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the quarrel about the kind of Officers here mentioned, it ſufficing to our purpoſe what is very evident, that they who are Governours of the Church, muſt be given to the Church by Chriſt. But Chriſt acting no longer politically or viſibly (as hath been ſaid and muſt be yielded) but myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he cannot be ſaid to ordain any immediately in his own perſon, but by the miniſtry of others. Now how is it poſſible to diſtinguiſh them whom Chriſt hath appointed to conſtitute others in the Church, from them to whom he hath given no ſuch order, but by this ſucceſſion we now ſpeak of, namely a traduction of that faculty which is in one deriving it originally, though by many intermediate hands, from Chriſt himſelf, to another ſucceeding him: becauſe (as the Apoſtle to the Hebrews ſpeaks) the <hi>Prieſts are not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of Death.</hi> This<note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 23.</note> ſurrogation then of Paſtors and Prieſts is not to be at the pleaſure or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of men, to inſtitute; but muſt be by the will of Chriſt: and this will of Chriſt muſt be revealed unto us either by the ordinary <hi>line</hi> and courſe from himſelf and Apoſtles, or elſe muſt by ſome extraordinary and miraculous way be made known to men. For though we deny it to be Chriſts practiſe to commiſſion men to theſe ends, we do not deny it to be in his power ſo to do: but that he hath ſo done actually to the faireſt Pretenders, we ſhall deny until better demonſtrations than can be made from their own aſſeverations, or appealings to the extraordinary effects of their Miniſtry.

This evil is only remedied by a ſucceſſive and ordinary tranſmiſſion of that Power which Chriſt left, with certain peculiar perſons he called, Apoſtles, with authority to communicate the

So that ſucceſſion not of Doctrine only, but Officers in the Church, is no leſs eſſential to a Church properly ſo called, than Officers themſelves or Diſcipline.

It may be an exception will here be put in againſt the compariſon from the unlawfulneſs of this latter, and not of the former: but I ſuppoſe as well an unlawfulneſs in the former, though not ſo notorious, as in the latter: And adde, That however, conſidered in it ſelf, it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to ſpoil another, yet if God calls me to it, it is not; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new Doctrine of Vocation, a man is then inwardly called, when he is enabled to do a thing. But an Outward call too is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that ordinary too, when things are ſetled to our mind, otherwiſe extraordinary calling muſt ſuffice. And truly an extraordinary calling will ſuffice at any time; but then very much better proofs are expected to make ſuch extraordinary Vocation apparent to equal judges, than we can any where find in the Apologies of them that reſt wholly upon that, as their ſafeſt Anchorage in this unhappy fluctuating Vocation.</p>

By this ſeparation therefore it may be concluded, That one, or perhaps both are in fault, and guilty, but agreeing within themſelves equally, (as well they may) and for ought appears, the Schiſmatical may be in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unity within it ſelf than the Catholick, how can any man diſcern from unity, which is the Catholick or true Church. The Unity therefore, which may any wiſe deſcribe or diſtinguiſh the ſounder part of Chriſts Church from the heretical, muſt not be taken from that which it holdeth within it ſelf, but with ſome other, which is acknowledged for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; wherein comes the uſe of Antiquity again: becauſe the Ancient Churches of Chriſt were ſaved by the ſame Faith and Worſhip that all ſucceeding Churches muſt be; therefore, if it may appear that a Church doth not agree in all neceſſary or conſiderable points of Faith, Worſhip, and Government with them of former ages, ſuppoſed to be truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it ſelf cannot be Catholick or a true Chriſtian Church. But they who look no higher than one Age, or two, and no farther then one place or two, and finding convenient agreement amongſt themſelves, do characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe themſelves for Chriſts Church, fall into the cenſure of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians—who meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing</hi>

                     <p>Hence they proceed to Univerſality too, as a ſign of the true Church, and an help to Unity it ſelf.

Hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 4.</note> Law was made that none ſhould call themſelves Catholicks but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved aright concerning the Holy Trinity; the reſt ſhould be termed Hereticks. Afterward, notwithſtanding every Sect and Hereſie uſurped that name: as may appear from that very place corruptly cited out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſt. Epiſt. ad Epiſtolam Fundamenti.</note> by ſome, to prove the true Church from the Title of <hi>Catholick</hi> it ſelf.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55232:88"/>
For ſaith he, however all Hereticks deſire to be called Catholicks, yet if any enquired for a Catholick Church, they were directed to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and not Heretical Churches.</p>
                     <p>But if we take the word <hi>Catholick</hi> in a more reſtrained ſenſe, not for that which is all over the world actually, but ſo far as it doth extend, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth generally through all; and that not Places, but Ages too, where ſhall we find a Catholick Church? Chriſtians never for fourteen or fifteen hundred yeers not conſpiring into one belief, no not in things held ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important to Faith: and I mean not only ſingle perſons, but Societies of Chriſtians. Therefore, neither from hence can we conclude directly of the true Church, in oppoſition to Heretical. And therefore the Patrons of this opinion of the Univerſality, finding themſelves harder pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with difficulties, than they can evade being taken in their own ſnares, are forced, according to their very vain cuſtom, to leave off the tryal of the truth from matter of Fact, which is moſt plain and ready, and proceed to ſay, <hi>It ought ſo to be:</hi> for certain reaſons they draw at their pleaſure out of Scripture, and the neceſſity of our knowledge of it: which is as ſolid a way of proceeding, as if I finding my ſelf by natural ſenſe cold, another ſhould attempt to demonſtrate the contrary, becauſe it is Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſommer.</p>
                     <p>But this uſe we may yet make of Univerſality to jude of Catholickneſs of Faith, taking it for the moſt conſtant for time, place, and perſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as all humane account requires to aſcribe that to the more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and eminent, which is ſtrictly proper only to the whole entire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as a Councel or Senate is ſaid to decree a thing, when the chiefeſt do ſo, ſome diſſenting: ſurely this is a very probable argument of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickneſs of that Faith, and conſequently that Church ſo believing: But what we before obſerved muſt not be forgotten here, <hi>viz.</hi> That in all ſuch enquiries as theſe, the Eſtimate muſt be taken from the whole Church paſſed as well as Preſent, and that there is as well an Eminency of Ages, as Perſons, to preponderate in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the advantage Negative from Univerſality is very conſiderable to diſcern the true Faith and Church from falſe, becauſe it is moſt certain, if any Doctrine or Diſcipline ſhall be obtruded on the Church, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made evident to have been actually received in the Church (and not by colourable and probable conjectures and new ſenſes of Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to that purpoſe) in ſome former Age, that is Heretical and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and in no good ſenſe Catholick.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Note which we ſhall mention is Sanctity, which we hold very proper to this end, taken abſtractedly from all Perſons, as conſidered in Doctrine and Principles. For if any Church doth teach contrary to the Law of nature, of moral vertues, of Juſtice, or the like, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that to be a falſe Church, though it keeps it ſelf never ſo ſtrictly to the Rule of Scriptures in many, or moſt other things. For it is in the power of mans wit, and may be in the power of his hands, to deviſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Religious Acts, and impoſe them on others, which ſhall carry a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhew of ſeverity and ſanctity than there is any grounds for in Scripture, or Preſidents in the beſt approved Churches: and yet this is not true Holineſs of Believers. For to this is principally required, that it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and warranted by Gods holy Word: Yet neither ſo directly and expreſly as if it were unlawful to act any thing in order to Holineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial precept from thence. For I ſee no cauſe at all to reject the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55232:88"/>
ancient diſtinction found frequently with the Fathers of the Church, of duties of Precept, and duties of Councel: For there ever was, and ought to be in Chriſts Church ſeveral ranks of Profeſſours of Chriſts Religion; whereof, for inſtance, ſome live more contemplative, ſome more active lives. But if all commendable and profitable States were under Precept, then ſhould all ſin that do not obſerve the ſame: but God hath taken a mean courſe in not commanding ſome things of ſingular uſe to the promoting of Piety in true Believers, but commending the ſame unto us: Such are Virginal chaſtity, Monaſtick life, Travelling painfully not only towards the ſalvatian of a mans own ſoul, but of others likewiſe; and certain degrees uncommand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Duties commanded; as of charity towards our Chriſtian neighbours, &amp; Watchings unto Prayer, and ſpiritual Devotion; which being preſcribed, no man can determine to what degree they are by God required of us preciſely: ſome therefore are left to the Freewill-offerings of devouter perſons, who thereby endeavour either to aſſure themſelves more fully of their ſalvation; or increaſe of the glory afterward to be received: For as Chriſt tells us in the Goſpel, <hi>Much was forgiven to Mary, becauſe ſhe loved much,</hi> ſo ſhall much be given upon the ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>They therefore that teach contrary to ſuch wholeſome and uſeful means of Holineſs as theſe, or the like, under, perhaps, vain ſuſpicion of too great opinion may be had of their worthineſs, incur, at leaſt with me, the cenſure of being enemies to the holineſs of Chriſts Church, and render their Churches more ſuſpected for the oppoſing of them, than others for approving or practiſing them.</p>
                     <p>The Holineſs then of the Church commending it to the eye and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, doth conſiſt in the divineneſs and ſpiritualneſs of its Doctrine and Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline in uſe in it, exceeding moral civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For it may be that ſuch a ſevere hand of civil Juſtice may be held over a people that they may live more orderly and inoffenſively to the world than ſome true Chriſtian Churches: but if this be done, as often it is, out of civil Prudence, natural Gravity, or a diſpoſition inclined rather to get an eſtate, than riotouſly and vainly to ſpend on, which brings ſuch ſcandal to Religion, then is not this a ſign of a true Church, or Chriſtian, becauſe it proceedeth not from principles proper to Chriſtian Religion, but ſecular intereſt, how ſpecious ſoever it may appear to the World.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the Power and Acts of the Church. Where they are properly poſited. Of the Fountain of the Power denyed to the Church. Neither Prince nor People Authour of the Churches Power: But Chriſt the true Head of the Church. The manner how Chriſts Church was founded. Four Concluſions upon the Premiſſes. 1. That there was alwayes diſtinction of Perſons in the Church of Chriſt. 2. The Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes adminiſtred principally by the Clergy. 3. The Rites generally received in the Church, neceſſary to the conferring Clerical Power and Office. 4. All are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of Eccleſiaſtical Power who have not thus received it. In what ſenſe Kings may be ſaid to be Heads of the Church.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter the Church found, and founded as aboveſaid, the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Acts thereof claim due conſideration, and the Power or Right of ſo acting. And this Power we make two-fold in General, Political and Myſtical, or Sacramental: Of both which we muſt firſt enquire after the proper Subject, before we treat of the proper Acts thereof.</p>
                     <p>That all Power which is given by Chriſt doth reſide in the Church as its ſubject, no man can, or doth queſtion. But becauſe the Church it ſelf being (as is ſaid) a Society united in one Faith, and adminiſtred out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by Chriſtian Diſcipline, according to Chriſts mind, admitteth of ſeveral ſenſes and acceptations; therefore it muſt be firſt underſtood, which, and in what ſenſe is according to Chriſts intention, the proper ſeat of this power. And before we come to Scriptural grounds, we take no ſmall help in this Enquiry from the common ſtate of all Government: which we have already ſhown to be ſuch as is not <hi>aſcending,</hi> but <hi>deſcending:</hi> It cometh not originally, nor can, from the multitude or people, who are the object of this power, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Perſons properly to be governed, and not governing; all the Examples of former Ages confirming not only the unnaturalneſs and unreaſonableneſs, but impoſſibility of the People governing themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:55232:89"/>For though infinite Inſtances may be given of Cities, and Nations, which have wrung the Civil Power out of the hands of their Princes and Magiſtrates, and pretended they would be ruled by their own Counſels and power: yet could they never effect this, but were conſtrained, after all devices uſed to no purpoſe, to let go their hold, if not Pretenſions, and ſuffer the aſſumed Power to return to a more capable ſubject. Which incapacity of uſing ſuch Power is no leſs then an unanſwerable Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me that it was never there placed by any divine Will or Right; but ſomewhere elſe. Now though ſome eminent Reformers of the Late Age have been ſo ſuperfluouſly, and in truth, ſuperſtitiouſly nice, and as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, jealous for Chriſts honour and abſolute Headſhip over his Church, that would not ſo much as allow the name of Government to the Church or any in it, leaſt Chriſt ſhould ſuffer loſs, but <hi>adminiſtration</hi> muſt be the<note place="margin">Junius de Eccleſia.</note> name ſignifying power and Rule exerciſed in the Church; yet in truth, all this is no better then a Superſtitious fear, where there is no fear. For they are not names, but things that are ſo much to be heeded: And if theſe men in their Charge, had not acted the part of Governours, as well as others, we might have allowed this invention for tollerable, but the truth is, the honour pretended to Chriſt, and the Gentle uſage of the People have ended in the ſame thing which the other more openly and honeſtly profeſſed to do: the difference being only in the Hands ſo acting. But 'tis no new thing to beguile diſſetled people with new words, into new orders, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it ever be left off, as common a Stratagem as it is, ſo long as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are people, and Craft and Ambition ſhall ſpurrmen of Fortune to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſcratch that unruly beaſt, to the end that, when they find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, they may get up of them, and ride them at their pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>This incapacity of all Chriſtians to rule themſelves being the ſame with the other, neceſſarily inferreth a more proper ſubject of that Power, which not being aſſumed but delivered, any more then the Faith it ſelf, founds a diſtinction of Chriſtians and the Church, as ancient as the Church it ſelf; not unknown to Civil Societies. For as hath been ſaid, a Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is ſaid to decree and act ſuch a thing, when not the thouſand part thereof ſo much as know any thing of it, till it be done: ſo that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a Nation Real and Repreſentative, and Formal and proper. This conſiſteth of all Perſons in that Society, and every member of that Political Bodie: The other, of ſuch Principal Parts of that Bodie as are in Poſſeſſion of autority and power to Rule the reſt: and whoſe Acts are interpreted to be the Acts of the whole State. And that the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of infinite Perſons uncapable of conſulting or acting Decretorily, muſt, and alwayes had certain Select Perſons repreſenting the whole, which it ſhould conclude; the thing it ſelf together with Precedents of all Places and Ages do prove. The greateſt arguments and moſt colourable are taken from the Infancy of the Church, to the contrary. For both Hereticks and Schiſmaticks endeavour at contrary concluſions from the Scripture. Patrons of the Popes abſoluteneſs argue from a Superiority or Primacy of order in St. <hi>Peter</hi> when the Church conſiſted, it may be, of twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to make good the Popes pretenſions to ſupremacy over the univerſal Church, when it conſiſteth of ſo many Nations. But to this our anſwer is ready: Firſt, that the like power was never in St. <hi>Peter</hi> over his fellow Apoſtles and the Reſt that is claimed by the Preſent Biſhop of Rome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That if ſuch a Power as is aſſerted to St. <hi>Peter</hi> for the Popes ſakehad ever been in him really, yet it could be no good ground of his Succeſſors
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55232:90"/>
claiming the ſame over the Catholick Church. And that Firſt, becauſe there is no probability of the like Gifts and Graces requiſite to ſuch Autority in the Popes of Rome, as were given by Chriſt to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> yea, there are more inſtances to be given of the Ignorance, and horrible vitiouſneſs of Perſons poſſeſſing that Chai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, then in any other Patriarchal See in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. Secondly, There is no Rule of Certainty (ſetting aſide the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal incapacities and imperfections) how far the Apoſtolical power was derived to their Succeſſors, but what may be taken from the end of ſuch power, which was to conſerve the Church in due order of Government, Devotion and Faith, and this may as well and better be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one Perſons engroſſing to himſelf the Diſpoſal of all things Primarily, though not in the Execution. Thirdly, the difference is vaſt between the Church conſiſting of ſo few, and contracted into ſo narrow a circuit as at the firſt founding of it, when one man might have with great facility ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the whole management of the Church upon him, and in following Ages, when it was diffuſed into ſo many and far diſtant quarters of the Univerſe, not to be inſpected or managed by one man, though an Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, Perſons of Democratical Principles and purpoſes, finding in holy Writ that the whole Church without diſtinction of Perſons were often aſſembled together, and that during their ſuch meeting, matters concerning the due adminiſtration of the Church, were treated of, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from thence, that in right, and not rather occaſionally, they concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Publick Acts of the Church: but this likewiſe is a fallacy, without any neceſſity of conſequence, as will appear from the original and orderly ſearch made into the firſt Conſtitution, and the gradual Progreſs of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Perſons and functions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, That Chriſt is the Head of the Church, and under that General notion of Power, life and motion doth communicate his influence unto his Body, the Scripture is ſo manifeſt, and it is ſo generally and willingly by all aſſented to, that it were loſt time to inſiſt on it. He is then by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequence the fountain of all Power reſting in that Body; as doth appear from the ſeveral Appellations ſubordinate to that of Head attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him in Scripture. For Hebrews the third and firſt, he is called <hi>The Apoſtle of our profeſſion.</hi> And in the Book of the Acts he is ſtiled that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 1. Acts. 3. 22. Deut. 18. 15. Luk. 4. 18.</note> which was in Deuteronomie promiſed to the true Iſrael. And an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt he is made to us by his own words verifying the Prediction of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias</hi> upon himſelf, Saying, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth him our<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 25. Mat. 23. 10.</note> Biſhop. Doctour or Maſter he claims as proper to himſelf in St. <hi>Mathew:</hi> And to the Hebrews, as before, he is called a Prieſt, an High prieſt, yea laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Deacon or Miniſter, for the words properly uſed ſignify the ſame<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 8.</note> thing. From all which we may gather both the Efficient and Exemplary cauſe of the ſeveral orders in Chriſt: For firſt, we read how he called unto himſelf twelve Apoſtles, as well to miniſter under him, during his abode upon earth, as to Preſide and inform his Church after his departure out of this World: which according to St. <hi>Hierome</hi> were prefigured by the twelve fountains, the twelve Patriarchs, the twelve Tribes, the twelve Princes of<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 27. Mark. 3. 14.</note> the Tribes. There he not only elected, but ordained alſo, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that they ſhould be with him, and that he might ſend them out to preach, naming them Apoſtles, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> writeth. After the choice and<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 13. Mat. 10. 1. Luk. 9. 2. Math. 10. 1. Math. 10. 10.</note> Ordination of them, he gave them actual Miſſion, as it appeareth by St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and Commiſſion to preach, and to work miracles to the confirmation of his Doctrine: and to receive a reward for their pains.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:55232:90"/>And when the Harveſt was too great for ſo few Labourers as twelve, St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, he added Adjutants to them, ſeventy Diſciples anſwerable to<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 1. Numb. 11. 10</note> the ſeventy Elders, by Gods appointment ſet over the children of Iſrael: and the ſeventy Souls that went with <hi>Jacob</hi> into Egypt. Theſe two orders<note place="margin">Gen. 46.

Now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe the common ſort of Chriſtians or Diſciples, which were if not at the time of Chriſts abode upon earth, yet afterward, Chriſtians: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth, where he affirmeth <hi>Chriſt was ſeen after his reſurrection of</hi>

And it is moſt certain that as the Apoſtles did not ſo much as chooſe their Lord, nor the Evangeliſts the Apoſtles, ſo the Common ſort did not then conſtitute or chooſe their Preachers or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: but while Chriſt continued on earth he kept the power of Ordination of whom he pleaſed in his own hands, and never is it ſo much as inſinuated that upon his departure he left any power in their hands to diſpoſe Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Affairs or Perſons therein: but that with his Apoſtles as ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in viſible Adminiſtration, he depoſited this power many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are offer'd us out of Scripture.

And that the whole Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical<note place="margin">Acts. 20. 28.</note> Juriſdiction was entirely in the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, doth appear from the enumeration of the moſt principal parts of which ſuch Jurisdiction doth conſiſt, which may be theſe as we find them in Scripture recorded. 1. Power of determining Controverſies of Religion, as appeareth from the Queſtion agitated about keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts. 15.</note> and concluded by the Apoſtles, and Elders which were of the ſecond Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after the Apoſtles. And in the eleventh of the Acts, the ſame reſolved<note place="margin">Acts. 11.</note> the doubt concerning the Converſing with Gentiles. 2. Of impoſing Laws and orders for the due and ſober converſation in matters of Moral nature, as may be gathered from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Theſſalonians, where he adviſeth, That Chriſtians <hi>ſtudy to be quiet and to do their own buſineſs, and to work with</hi>

                        </gap> which, theſe four concluſions do neceſſarily follow. Firſt, that by Chriſt and his Apoſtles intention, there were alwayes, in their dayes, diſtinction of perſons in the Church: ſome having the power of Rule, and ſome being ſubject: according to the Compariſon of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians of the natural order and ſuperiority of, and ſubjection of the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> Members in a natural Body, to one another: and coming to application,<note place="margin">v 28.</note> be ſaith, <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, Firſt Apoſtles: ſecondarily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles:</hi> And by demanding, and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning,<note place="margin">v. 29, 30.</note> doth vehemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Perſons was no otherwiſe known at firſt but by the common name of Brethren, given to ſuch as were Chriſtians, without any autority in the Church: and therefore we read often of the Apoſtles and their Party on the one ſide, and Brethren on the other. But the Officers and Rulers of the<note place="margin">Acts. 11. 1, 12, 17, 15, 23, 16. 2.</note> Church are not found to have any general name diſtinguiſhing them from others, but were by their particular charges and Offices known to men: as Apoſtles, Elders, Biſhops, Evangeliſts, Deacons. But afterward, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſneſs of ſpeech, general cemprehenſion of them ſo diſtinct requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they received their ſeveral Names, not, as <hi>Socinus, Salmaſius,</hi> and ſome ſuch preſumptuous traders for Anarchy in the Church would have it, the things themſelves, or being. For it is granted, that at firſt all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers<note place="margin">

                        </gap>, or Gods Portion or Clergy as we now ſpeak. For it is very probable that St. <hi>Peter</hi> uſing that word which we render Clergy, doth intend to comprehend thereby all Chriſtian People, as well as they who (as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith are the Lords portion more peculiarly: But with good advice afterward, they who were more eſpecially dedicated to Gods ſervice, and attended his Altar, were ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Clergy: and the other the <hi>Laity</hi> or people: very agreeably to the phraſe of the Old Teſtament, where we find not only a diſtinction in the things themſelves; but in the names of ſuch as ſerved any ways in Gods houſe, and thoſe who were only Iſraelites at large. For theſe were called ſimply <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Secondly: From what is ſaid we may conclude that even before, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this diſtinction, all the adminiſtration of Church affairs paſſed through the hands of theſe Perſons of the Clergy or Eccleſiaſtical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and that their Votes and Acts ever went under the name of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55232:91"/>
Church, it may be that in the beginning of the Church, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had not ſo many advantages, as after they had, and their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of aſſembling was not ſo great, but they were conſtrained to teach, and pray, and determine controverſies, and ordain Laws for the Church, that the Laity (as we now call them) were preſent at all theſe; but that this fortuitous preſence ſhould inferr a right, nothing appears.</p>
                     <p>A third Concluſion may be, That, obſerving the orderly Rites uſed to inveſt any perſon with a Clerical Power, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that they who wanted them, never attained the thing it ſelf. For the Author to the Hebrews aſſerts plainly the ſacredneſs of Evangelical Miniſtring,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> from the Preſcriptions and practiſe of the Levitical, ſaying, <hi>No man takes this office upon him but he that was called of God, as was Aaron:</hi> and leaſt it might be preſumed that this ſtrickneſs concerned the Old Law only, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to that greateſt of Precedents, Chriſt himſelf: who, though he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not any Inſtitution, being abſolutely free to all ſuch purpoſes, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet was called of God in ſignal manner; to ſhew that all that exerciſe ſuch Sacred function ſhould much more be thereunto orderly called. Now to underſtand what this ordinary and orderly <hi>call</hi> is, the better, it is worth the obſerving how <hi>Aaron</hi> was called, for ſo in proportionable manner ought all under the Goſpel be ordained to the Miniſtry. And here firſt, we may note, there is not the leaſt intimation given of ſuch a Call as is Internal, upon which many vainly reſt: But <hi>Aaron</hi> was called not only internally, by certain proper and ſufficient Gifts to that Office; but <hi>externally,</hi> and that not of himſelf, but of another: He was called by God. Now leaſt it ſhould be here ſuſpected that a bare and bold preſumption of being called of God, without ſome outward evidence prooving the ſame, might ſuffice to juſtify an Intruder of himſelf into the Miniſtry; the Scripture tells us how <hi>Aaron</hi> was called of God; and that is not only of God and immediately, but mediately, by man; that is, by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Nay farther, becauſe many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with ſuch an Ordination as comes from another, not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning much what power or Right ſuch perſons have ſo to ordain others, the Scriptures tell us, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was called by another, and him appointed ſpecially by God ſo to do: as we read, Exodus the 28. 1. where<note place="margin">Exod. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer, here indeed doth <hi>Calvins</hi> defence of himſelf, and ſuch as are in like condition take place of an Ordinary call and an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. For before God had ſetled a Rule and Order in his Church, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and immediate hand of God, did appoint perſons to miniſter before. It was therefore firſt of all, an Extraordinary Act in God to call <hi>Moſes,</hi> rather than any others, to direct and Rule his Church; it was next an Extraordinary Act in him to ſeparate the whole Tribe of Levi to Miniſter before him: but from that time forward, there was no ſuch thing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55232:92"/>
heard of, as an Extraordinary Call. Secondly, I anſwer that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to us Rules and Precedents, doth not thereby ſo tie his own hands, as he doth ours; but when he pleaſeth, he may create Perſons in Extraordinary manner, to what ends he will: And his Autority infallibly granted to thoſe, we call now, <hi>Lay-men,</hi> is altogether ſufficient to make a Prieſt of what Order or dignity ſoever he ſhall be. But until ſuch infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Proofs of either Gods immediate Calling, which is Extraordinary indeed; or his immediate enabling or empowring any other Perſon, not having in the ordinary Courſe eſtabliſhed in his Church, received ſuch a power, be given; all ſuch Extraordinary aſſuming of the Miniſtery on a mans ſelf is more then one way Extraordinary, and to be rejected as void. And with ſuch no good and conſcientious Chriſtian ought to Communicate, as with Prieſts; that is, as Offering the Spiritual Sacrifice of Prayer and Praiſe unto God as a Legitimate and Publick Miniſter of God, or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the People, or that Miſtical Sacrifice in the Euchariſt; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially going upon the grounds of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Perkins</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Great note: that all Sacerdotal (they may call them if they pleaſe Miniſterial) Acts done by him who is no true Miniſter, are really null and void.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we conclude, that ſeeing all Eccleſiaſtical power, as Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, doth proceed from Chriſt, and his Succeſſors, and that by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and viſible means, they who have not received the ſame by ſuch Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Methods, are uſurpers of the ſame, whether Political or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical. And that to deny this to the Church, is to deny that which Chriſt hath given them, and ſuch a Principle of the Churches well Being, without which it cannot ſubſiſt; and it not ſubſiſting, neither can the Faith it ſelf. And to the reaſon above given we may add Preſcription, beyond all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. For from Chriſts time to this day a perpetual and peculiar power hath ever been in the Clergy (which hath conſtantly likewiſe born the name of the Church) to aſſemble, define, and diſpoſe matters of Religion. And why ſhould not Preſcription under Unchriſtian, as well as Chriſtian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for ſo many Ages together, be as valid, ſacred, and binding to acknowledgment in the Caſe of Religion, as Civil Matters; will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a queſtion, in Conſcience and common Equity, even after irreſiſtible Power hath forced a Reſolution otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>It is true, ſuch is the more natural and Ancient Right Civil Power hath over the outward Perſons of men, than that which Religion hath over the Inward man, that it may claim a dominion and diſpoſal of the Perſons of even Chriſtian ſubjects, contrary to the ſoft and infirm Laws of the Church: becauſe (as hath been ſaid) Men are Men, before they are Chriſtians; and Nature goeth before Grace: And Civil ſociety is the <hi>Baſis,</hi> and ſupport to Eccleſiaſtical. Yet the grounds of Chriſtianity being once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for good and divine; and that Religion cannot ſubſiſt, nor the Church conſiſt without being a Society; and no Society without a Right of counſel, and conſultation; and no conſultation without a Right to aſſemble together; the Right of aſſembling muſt needs be in trinſique to the Church it ſelf. Now, if no man that is a Chriſtian can take away the eſſential ingredient to the Church, how can any deny this of Aſſembling? For the practiſe of it conſtantly and confidently by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and brethren, contrary to the expreſs will of the Lawful Powers of the Jews and Romans, and the reaſon given in the Acts of the Apoſtles of obeying God rather then man, do imply certainly a Law and Charter from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55232:92"/>
God ſo to do, and if this be granted, as it muſt, who can deny by the ſame Rule, neceſſity of Cauſe, and conſtant Preſcription, that they may as well provide for the ſafety of the Faith by ſecuring the ſtate of the Church; as for the truth, and ſtability of the Church, by ſecuring the true Faith, by doctrine and determination.</p>
                     <p>The Great queſtion hath ever been, Whether the Church ſhould ſuffer loſs of power and priviledges upon the Supream Powers becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſtian: Or the Supream power it ſelf, looſe that domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it had before it became of the Church? For, if Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubjected Kings neceſſarily to the Laws of others, not deriving from them, then were not Kings in ſo good a Condition after they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as before; when they had no ſuch pretences or reſtraints upon them: and ſo ſhould Chriſts Law deſtroy, or maim at leaſt, the Law of God, by which Kings reign. But there may be ſomewhatſaid weakning this abſurdity. For Granting this, That there is a God, and that he is to be worſhipped, and that as he appointeth (all which we muſt by nature believe) it ſeems no leſs natural to have theſe obſerved, than the Laws of natural Dominion. Now granting that at preſent, which (if we be true to our Religion) we muſt not deny: <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtian Religion is the true Religion, and that God will be worſhipped in ſuch ſort as is therein contained; For any Prince abſolute, to ſubmit to the eſſentials of that Religion, is not to looſe any thing of his Priſtine Rights which he had before being an Heathen (for he never had any Right to go againſt the Law of God, more then to go againſt the Law of Nature) but it doth reſtrain his Acts, and the exerciſe of his Power. And if the Supream, after he hath embraced Chriſtianity, ſhall proceed to exert the ſame Authority over the Church, as before; yet the Church hath no power to reſiſt or reſtrain him, Civilly; any more than when he was an Alien to it.</p>
                     <p>Now it being apparent that Chriſtian Faith and Churches had their Forms of believing, and Communion before Soveraign powers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and that he, who is truly converted to a Religion, doth embrace it, upon the terms which he there finds, not ſuch as he brings with him or deviſes; therefore there lies an Obligation upon ſuch powers, to preſerve the ſame, as they found it, inviolate. And truly, for any ſecular Power to become Chriſtian, with a condition of inverting the orders of the Church, and deluting the Faith, is to take away much more than ordinary accrues unto it by ſuch a change. It is true, the diſtinction is conſiderable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Power of a Chriſtian, and unchriſtian King, exerted in this manner; becauſe taking the Church in the Largeſt ſenſe, in which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in Communion are of it, what Chriſtian Kings act with the Church, may, in ſome ſenſe, bear the name of the Church, as it doth in the State, acting according to their ſecular capacity, but much more improperly there than here: becauſe there are no inferiour Officers, or Magiſtrates in ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which are not of his founding and inſtitution; whatſoever they do referr to him, and whatſoever almoſt he doth, is executed by them. But Chriſt (as we have ſhewed) having ordained ſpecial Officers of his own, which derive not their Spiritual Power at all, from the Civil; and to this end that his Church might be duly taught and governed, what is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of theſe, can in no proper ſenſe bear the name of the Church. But many ſay, the King is a Mixt perſon conſiſting partly of Eccleſiaſtical and partly Civil Authority: but this taken in the ordinary latitude, is to begg the Queſtion, and more a great deal than at firſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55232:93"/>
For who knows how far this Mixture extends, and that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends not the Myſtical Power of the Church, as well as the Political: And how have they proved one more than the other, by ſuch a title? It were reaſonable therefore, firſt to declare his Rights in Eccleſiaſtical matters, as well as Civil, and thence conclude, he is a Mixt Perſon; and not to affirm barely he is a <hi>Mixt Perſon,</hi> and from thence inferr they know not what Eccleſiaſtical power themſelves. And if he hath ſuch power, whether it is immediately of God annexed to his Natural Right; or, by conſent of the Church, is attributed unto him. For by taking this courſe we may reconcile many otherwiſe contrary opinions found amongſt the Ancient Fathers, ſometimes aſcribing much of the Eccleſiaſtical Power to Chriſtian Emperours, and ſometimes calling the ſame in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The Church of England, ſo far as ſhe hath declared herſelf herein, ſeemeth to take the mean way, and follow herein the Preſcriptions of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: and the Precedents of Chriſtian Emperors found in the Antient Church, under the Goſpel, and doth profeſs to be the due of our Kings, as much as ever any Kings upon earth, to ſway in Eccleſiaſtical matters. In execution of which power, as there was alwayes approbation modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the cuſtomes of the Church, ſo was there always Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition when the bounds were exceeded. And undoubtedly true is That we are taught by our Church to acknowledge, <hi>That whatever in Church</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conſtitutions and Canons Church of <hi>England Can.</hi> 2.</note> 
                        <hi>matters was the Right of Jewiſh Kings, or Chriſtian Emperours of Old, is ſo now the Right of our Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſome not content herewith have out of the Title of Head given at the firſt attempts of Reformation to our King, and made by acts of State Hereditary to his ſucceſſors, drawn an argument to prove all that power which reſted in the Church to be devolved on the Kings of this Nation. But this hath ever been diſowned and diſclaimed in ſuch a large ſenſe by themſelves, as appears by Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunctions, and an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in confirmation whereof: I ſhall here only recite the opinion or teſtimony of Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his view of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> his ſeditious Bull<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> againſt the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius 5th.</hi>
                        </note> againſt her, in theſe his own word. <hi>Where is the called Supream Head? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the Acts of Parliament, the Records, the Rolls, and the Writs of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery or Exchequer which paſs in her Graces name. Where is ſhe ever called Supream Head of the Church? No, No brethren, ſhe refuſeth it, ſhe would not have it, nor be ſo called: Why then doth Chriſts Vicar blaze and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſo groſs an untruth? &amp;c.</hi> This was her Judgement and modeſty then when there was greateſt cauſe to apprehend ſome ſuch thing: and what ſhe thought of it, I never could learn was ever otherwiſe interpreted by her Succeſſors. For notwithſtanding that, according to the moſt ancient and undoubted Rights of this Emperial Crown, our Kings are ſupream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church as well as State: yet never was it expounded of the Church as they were Eccleſiaſtical, but as they were of Civil capacity: For herein differeth the Right of Kings according to our Reformation from that of Roman Perſwaſion. That Clergy men becoming Sons of the Church, in more eſpecial manner than they of the Laity, are not thereby exempted from the Civil Power, either in matter of propertie, or Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalneſs. But the Roman Church ſo far exalted and extended their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Power, as to withdraw ſuch Perſons and their Caſes civil from Civil cognizance, and judgement, and aſſume it to themſelves. And this the Pope claiming very injuriouſly, as Head of the Church: To root up this uſurpation, <hi>Henry</hi> the eight null'd that his pretence, and took the title to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55232:93"/>
himſelf intending nothing more then to vindicate his Prerogative in that particular.</p>
                     <p>For though it cannot be denied that many and great Priviledges to this effect, have been of Old granted by Chriſtian Emperours to eminent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to judge of their own Sons (as they were called) within themſelves: yet did they never claim this, as a Native Right of the Church, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; but as an act of Grace, from the Civil Power. And though the Church, following therein the Councel of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to go to Law rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1.</note> the Juſt, than unjuſt: and that Chriſtians ſhould rather determine Cauſes of differences amongſt themſelves, by arbitration, than ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly apply themſelves to the Judgement Seat of Heathen, did ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to determine buſineſs within it ſelf, and yet more eſpecially, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: Yet they never denied a Right in Civil Autority to call them in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, upon miſdemeanours, or to decide their Caſes of Civil nature. And for the other, of Divine nature, or purely Eccleſiaſtical, Princes never expected or deſired to intermeddle therewith. This the Roman Deputy of <hi>Achaia, Gallio</hi> underſtood, not to concern his Juridical power, when<note place="margin">Act. 18.</note> he refuſed to be a Judge of ſuch matters, as were eſteemed Religious, though in that violence was offered to the body of St. <hi>Paul</hi> before his face, he might, and ought to have ſhewn his Autority. But when the Soveraign Power became Chriſtian, it was not thought unlawful at all, nor ſcandalous to addreſs themſelves to it for deciſion of Controverſies. And this is it which is intended to be demanded now by our Kings in their Supremacy, in Caſes Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and acknowledged by the Clergy of this Church to be his due, without that ſervile way of ſeeking leave from the Biſhop of Rome, or any under him. Onely where it may be ſhowed that Peculiar Grants of Exemptions from the common courſe of Juſtice have been made by Princes to the Clergy of the Church, may it not ſeem equal that they ſhould enjoy the benefit of them, as well as others, in other Caſes.</p>
                     <p>But nothing is more unreaſonable or intollerable then the impudence of thoſe ſpitefully and malitiouſly bent againſt the Religion profeſſed in our Church, who argue from the Kings Supremacy over the Church, ſuch an abſolute dominion there, as they will by no means acknowledge due to him in the State. If by Acts of Parliament a thing be confirmed to the Commonwealth, it is lookt on as inviolable by the King; and unalterable without the like ſolemn Revocation, as was the Conſtitution: But by vertue of the Ancient Right of the Crown, they would have it believed, the King may at his pleaſure alter ſuch ſolemn Acts made in behalf of the Church. Without the concurrence of the Three Eſtates nothing is lookt upon as a ſtanding Law to the Civil State: but by vertue of this Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Eccleſiaſtical, they would have it believed that without any more ado, without conſent or counſel of the Church, he may make what alteration of Religion he pleaſes; which was never heard or dreamt of; Yea, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as not only his Civil but Eccleſiaſtical Power always acknowledged the Bounds of common benefit, and extended not to deſtruction, they would have it thought that he may, when he pleaſeth, by vertue of ſuch Headſhip, deſtroy the Body of the Church and Religion, and leave none at all, ſo far at leaſt as the withdrawing of all ſecular aid and advantage do haſten its ruine. But they will not be of this opinion any longer than they have brought about their miſchievous purpoſes. Surely St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 12.</note> nothing to do at all with State matters, and could not touch one that was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55232:94"/>
without the Church by Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, was as much the Head of the Church as ever any Prince in Chriſtendom, doth expreſsly declare that whatſoever autority he had, it was for the edification and not deſtruction<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 8.</note> of the Church. The argument therefore taken from an Hereditary Right in the Crown of England of being Governour and Defendor of our Church to the apparent ruine and deſtruction of it, we know very well from whence it proceedeth, and whether it tendeth: but where it will end, as yet, God only knows. This we know that Papiſts are mad when that ſcoff and reproach which they have conſtantly put upon both King and Church, from that Title, upon due enquiry makes ſo little to their purpoſe. And therefore they will fight with us, with the name only.</p>

We ſee how Thieves, Robbers, Murderers, and ſuch like malefactors who are enemies to humane Society, be denied (and that juſtly) the benefit of that Society againſt which they have ſo offended by confinement in Priſon or depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life it ſelf, forfeited juſtly in ſeeking or acting the ruine of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And can any that grants the Communion of Chriſtians to be a Body knit together by its ſeveral joints and nerves, and conſiſting of ſeveral Members, deny but the like Evil may befal in its kind, to it, what doth happen to others in another: <hi>viz,</hi> that ſome noxious humor of Hereſie corrupting the Faith in which, as the Scripture ſaith of the Blood, is the life of a Chriſtian and the Church it ſelf; may poiſon it: And ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Schiſm may diſſolve or diſmember it? And ſhall not it be allowed the like remedy or means of Cure which are held neceſſary in like caſes? No opinion, how heretical or immoral ſo ever, is more pernicious to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55232:94"/>
Society than that which abſolutely denyes power to the Church to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unſound and tainting members out of it, and to provide for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Body even by the abſciſſion, and deſtruction of any one Part infeſting it. For this opinion ſtrikes not at one part of the Body, but all; neither at one point of Faith, but all; though not immediately and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but indirectly and by conſequence. For as upon the fall of the Houſe, the perſons within muſt needs be cruſht to death, ſo upon the diſſolution of the outward Frame of the Church, the Faith itſelf muſt of neceſſity in a ſhort time periſh, and be reduced to nothing. And therefore, thoſe men of reaſon (as they would be accounted) give us but little cauſe to think them better men, than Chriſtians, who affirm rawly and looſely, without qualification or due explication of their mind, that no man is to be caſt out of the Church but for ſomething which is neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or which Chriſt doth not require or forbid abſolutely: either deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not conſidering (a man can ſcarce tell which by their works) hereby that Chriſt, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and our Creed it ſelf require conſervation of the unity of the Church, both as a thing admirable in its ſelf, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Faith it ſelf. For any man therefore to broach or publiſh ſuch an opinion as this, That every man may uſe what Ceremonies he pleaſes in the publick ſervice of God; or if he pleaſes he may uſe none: and this, <hi>That the Church hath no power to command or forbid any thing which is not expreſſed in the Scripture:</hi> when as Rules general, and ſeveral Examples in Scripture juſtify the contrary. Theſe I ſay being contrary, not only to ſome one Church, but all; even thoſe they would by no means have touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, do no leſs in their conſequence, miſchief to the Church, than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the Myſtery of the Trinity it ſelf; or of Chriſts incarnation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I grant they, in their form are nothing, ſo foul. And therefore I preſume to conclude them matter of Excommunication; and ſo I judge St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, where he adviſes, nay commands in the name of the Lord<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 6.</note> Jeſus Chriſt (the Theſſalonians) <hi>to withdraw themſelves from every one that walketh diſorderly, and not after the tradition he received of us.</hi> Theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, were (as it is here implied) concerning orders of the Church, and manners of Worſhip: which in all probability are moſt of them loſt to us, St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore requiring that whoever did not walk according to thoſe preſcriptions delivered by him, ſhould be ſeparated, doth not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the like proceedings now. For tis the very ſame thing whether the Church withdraws it ſelf, or whether it expells another. When the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites warned by <hi>Moſes</hi> departed from the tents of the wicked <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Num. 16. 26</note> and <hi>Abiram</hi> (who only walked diſorderly not erroneouſly in the matter of worſhip, that we read of) and their complices, and touched nothing of theirs, they Anathematized them no leſs than if they had ſet them pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into remoter parts from the Congregation. Nay, if now-adayes, as lately Sectaries ſhould prevail ſo far as to poſſeſs themſelves of all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Lawful places of Worſhip, and eject the true Church, they might ſtand no leſs legally and Really Excommunicate than if they were thruſt formally from thence themſelves. For'tis not the place, but the Cauſe, and the Body from which they are cut, that makes the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication juſt and valid. This we are confirmed in by the ſame Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. <hi>And if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed.</hi> Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle, had delivered many things not eſſential in themſelves to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And where the company of Chriſtians was not great, and their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55232:95"/>
ſociety not formed, and their outward power little or nothing, as in the beginning of all Churches, there it ſufficed in liew of Formal excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to withdraw themſelves from ſuch troublers of the Church. And this we read further of in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans, ſaying, <hi>Now I beſeech</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>you brethren, mark them which cauſe Diviſions and offences contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> generally in his Epiſtles not only inſiſts upon unity of Faith but unity of Charity, and outward communion: they therefore that were Authors of unneceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are they whom he would have noted and avoided, which when it is done with Publick conſent, and ſentence is the ſame in effect with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: and therefore breeders of ſeparation, and diviſions are no leſs ſubject to excommunications than are Hereticks, though they hold nothing directly contrary to the Faith. But if men will ſay that, What St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, we may do, and no more, becauſe he did no more, this is invented only to deſtroy, but will not hold ſtrong enough: becauſe the examples of the Governours of the Church our Rules, are not to be reſtrained to the very ſame Caſes only, but to them of like general nature. St. <hi>Paul</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyes by his practice the excluding out of the communion of the Church ſuch as bred cauſeleſs contentions and diviſions and from hence the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Governors are juſtified in doing the like.</p>
                     <p>For, nothing can be ſaid leſs to the queſtion in hand than to recite many places out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanding to bear one anothers burdens, and that we ſhould not judge one another; and that the ſtrong ſhould bear with the weak; and ſuch like. For all theſe Texts ſpeak either of Churches not Formed or conſtituted, but rather breeding; or of ſingle perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves coming to Chriſtian Religion with the ſtrong prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Excellency of certain Rites before Religiouſly obſerved; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Reaſon, Juſtice, and Religion require that no man ſhould impoſe his conceit upon another, without autority. But do we find in any place of the Holy Scriptures that St. <hi>Paul</hi> denied this Right of Judging, cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and commanding, to the whole Church? Nothing leſs, yea nothing more than the contrary, as may more fully appear when we are to ſpeak of Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>But it is commonly (and as they think accutely) ſaid, that they are the Authors of diviſions and Schiſms, who will not do what they may to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them. And therefore, if Governours impoſe more then is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, or Faith, upon others, they muſt anſwer for the diviſions ariſing from this.</p>
                     <p>I may marvel, who before late years, (I may ſay rather dayes) ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Scriptures in this manner? but they will wonder perhaps again, I ſhould think they are no better interpreters and appliers of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than are to be found in times and ſocieties of old. Let that paſs; But ſo muſt not their miſtake, either of the power of the Church, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Charity, and common Juſtice. The power of the Church being meerly miniſterial and ſervile as to Chriſt, and the Rule of all Chriſtianity, the Scripture; but Magiſterial in relation to inferiour members, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth only to things of Chriſtian Prudence, and extrinſecal to Faith; and the things uncommanded in Scripture properly (For in other things it is determined without any power to vary from thence;) this done, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes all Right and Autority, as to outward matters: which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves approve of, in the practiſe, nor have done. But this is not all: for we ſay, that thoſe Governors are not the cauſe of Diviſions and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55232:95"/>
Schiſms who do not ſuſpend and withdraw all Injunctions extrinſecal to Faith, or good life, but they rather who do not receive and obey ſuch as are not contrary to either. This is the ſtate of the controverſie then between us; ſuppoſing there is Order and Legitimate autority conſtituted amongſt us, whether this is more, or ſo much bound for peace, and unity ſake, to gratifie ſuch as are in their rank, ſubject in the Lord to them in all things poſſible, according to the Scripture: or theſe, on the contrary, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to receive and obſerve all ſuch decrees and conſtitutions which are indeed much accuſed and traduced, but cannot be proved to be any wayes contrary to the word of God, or any Analogy of Faith, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by themſelves. And granting there were ſomewhat of Charity in reluxing of the rigour of Orders to be obſerved; is there not much more of Charity to be expected from them in obeying? How can they ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urge that upon others, which they are much more bound to keep and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe themſelves, but never reguard it? Does not Charity much more bind them to obey their Superiours, then their Superiours, them? Nay, can they lay any claim to a thing upon the account of Charity, who deny the ſame thing upon the account of Juſtice? Juſtice, and a debt of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence flowing from ſubjection, requires no leſs than Charity, a compliance of the Wills of the Inferiour with that of the Superiour: But only Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be pretended, and that only pretended, where there ſeems to be an indifference in the thing commanded. For if they betake themſelves to the inward temper and bent of particular conſciences oppoſing or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things, they muſt needs come off Looſers by ſuch trials. For there will ſoon be found conſciences, on the contrary, that will be as ſtiff and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute for the defenſe, as theirs are for the abrogations of ſuch indifferent things. No reaſon is poſſible to be given, why one conſcience may not think as well of them, finding them not forbidden; as another doth, evil, finding them not commanded. For the too vulgar doctrine which teacheth, That what is not commanded is forbidden in Scripture, is as notorious a falſity as any thing can be pretended upon the Scripture. But farther, we abſolutely declare againſt all ſuch tryals of Publick Laws and Cuſtomes; as Particular: and eſpecially private conſciences; as unjuſt and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and in trut intollerable, in all Churches. This is the Rule we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hold to, That nothing ought to be ordained or impoſed which may juſtly offend the conſcience, and that is only evil. If therefore, the thing it ſelf be acknowledged, or may reaſonably be proved to contain nothing ſinfull, (which only may offend the conſcience) it is one of thoſe evils which cannot be avoided; and ſuch of which Chriſt ſpeaketh in the Goſpel of St.<note place="margin">Luk. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>Luke, It is impoſſible but that offences will come.</hi> For, either the diſſenting, or Aſſenting conſcience muſt ſuffer: and which ſhould in ſuch caſes ſuffer who ſhould determine, but Autority? Was ever that choſen for a Rule which is infinite in uncertainties? So are mens conſciences in particular. But ſtill they are Inſtant and ſay, We grant ſuch things may be left undone without prejudice to the Faith. And to the ſame argument we return the ſame anſwer in effect as before, <hi>viz,</hi> And they grant, they may be done without prejudice to the Faith. But their Caſe is little leſs than ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if it be truly conſidered what they lay down, and what they crave at our hands. For Peace ſake (ſay they) we ought to yield what is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and all indifferent things: As if they much more were not ſo bound to do. But that we now add is, That there being two Parties diverſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, yet, as 'tis ſuppoſed, differing only in things of a middle nature
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55232:96"/>
between Good and Evil. If the one Partie ſhould come unto the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to have peace, and be at unity with it, on condition that it would yield all things that they may poſſibly, to them; were this any more than to ſay, They would be at peace and unity with them when they became of their mind, did as they would have them, and not differ from them? But I have tranſgreſſed I fear on this ſubject, here at preſent; which yet is not impertinent altogether, it proving that it is Lawful to Excommunicate ſuch who agree with us in Faith. And the ſumm of the reaſon is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe there are, as hath been acknowledged on both ſides, yea is almoſt on all ſides granted, two things eſſential to the Church, Doctrine, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or Diſcipline, as it is called; to act any thing to the violation of either of theſe, may juſtly ſubject a man to this Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure. And however at firſt ſight diſſenſion and oppoſition to the Rites and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Church may not appear of a mortal nature of themſelves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps about things in nature alterable, yet in the conſequence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a breach in the wall of the City of God, they let in certain ruine and deſtruction; Thieves and Robers.</p>
                     <p>And this holds no leſs to the Juſtification of the Church in Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating refractory and diſobedient perſons to the Church in her citations: though in truth, the ground of her citation be matter of ſmall moment. It were indeed much to be wiſh'd, that ſuch ſevere ſentences might not be executed but on occaſions of greateſt moment, not only for the perſons ſake ſo excluded, but the Churches ſake, denouncing: whoſe autority muſt needs be much weakened, and her ſentence much contemned, when upon matters appearing meerly trivial and light, it is inflicted: And therefore moſt uſeful it ſeemeth, That redreſs of pecuniary pretenſions on perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Eccleſiaſtical Courts ſhould not be by Excommunication, but from the Civil Power enabling the Eccleſiaſtical to exact their dues. But where this is not in uſe, and where no other means appears of obliging men to reverence and ſubmit to Eccleſiaſtical Powers, but the puniſhment Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; I would fain have ſuch perſons, who profeſs not the utter aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch autority and diſſolution, propound ſome other effectual way of keeping up the power and autority of thoſe Courts, beſides Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, before they declare ſo ſmartly againſt the abuſe of it. Laſtly, whoſoever doth by contempt and diſobedience firſt deny the Churches power and in very deed ſever himſelf from it, can he, or any man of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reaſon or modeſty contradict the Churches Act in declaring and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally manifeſting what was more cloſely, but really before done by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? So far as a man diſobeys and oppoſes the Church, ſo far is he really ſeparated from it. And to be partly on, and partly off, as ſome men propound to themſelves and pleaſe themſelves in, thinking it free to chooſe and leave at their pleaſure what their private judgements ſhall lead them to, is not at all to clear them from the guilt or imputation of Schiſmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; For all proper Schiſmaticks agree in many things with the Church which they trouble and divide. And every Schiſmatick ſtands divided from the Church. And may not the cenſure of the Church by Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt reaſonably at leaſt follow a mans own Act; and declare that to be ſo which himſelf hath made ſo; eſpecially not only thereby, or ſo much puniſhing the Offendor as ſecuring the innocent and ſound by ſuch notice from the like contagion? Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> cleerly imply ſo much, when<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note> he ſaith to the Gallatians, <hi>I would they were even cut off that trouble you?</hi> How did theſe intruders and ſeducers ſo trouble the Church as to deſerve
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55232:96"/>
ſuch Exciſion or Cutting off? By two things principally, one whereof follows in the next verſe, by a preſumption of ſuch Chriſtian Liberty which was never intended by Chriſt for his Church. Another was in point<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 6, 7.</note> of doctrine, innovating rather in form than words. For it was not another doctrine of the Goſpel that was offered to theſe green and unſtable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but another Form, the eaſier to prevail upon their Conſciences, and to alienate them from their true Paſtors. Such as theſe would the Apoſtle have Cut off: and therefore very falſe and frivolous is that ground of <hi>Socinian</hi> Extract, mentioned in the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing which in it ſelf hinders not ſalvation, can give juſt occaſion of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I do not here (as many) inſiſt much upon the words of Chriſt in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> whereby he warrants a man to account him, as Heathen and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,<note place="margin">Math. 18. 15, 16, 17.</note> who ſhall refuſe to hear the Church arbitrating, and judging within it ſelf; becauſe I am of their opinion who expound this not of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the Church, but of a freedom granted to a man to go to the humane Civil Power, for juſtice againſt ſuch a brother, as if he were no better than a Heathen and Publican, who will not liſten to the voice and judgement of the Church. Yet ſurely this intimates a power in the Church to determine, and a duty in the members of it, to ſubmit unto the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: and if a private man may treat one of his brethren as he would a heathen, in ſome caſes, may not the Church? This is the leaſt we can honeſtly make of Chriſts Charter given to the Church by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 19.</note> the ſame Goſpel, <hi>I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou ſhalt looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But conſideration and limitation of this grievous cenſure is not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, according to diverſity of Perſons, Relations, and the Cauſes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; from whence I ſuppoſe aroſe the diſtinction of <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> or <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Leſſer</hi> Excommunication, of ancient uſe in the Church. And <hi>Anathema</hi> and Excommunication according to the Ancient differ. For, Excommunication is nothing elſe but a denunciation of a perſon aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Communion of the Church, in the myſteries and worſhip proper to Chriſtians: And this we may take to be the Leſſer Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but <hi>Anathema,</hi> or the Greater Excommunication, beſides exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Chriſtian Communion, added a Curſe corporal, which the Scripture calls properly, <hi>a Delivering unto Satan,</hi> as well for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Body as Soul. Thus was that inceſtuous perſon excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> For the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may be<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. 5.</note> ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For though we ſay, that this <hi>Anathema</hi> was to the deſtruction of the fleſh, we mean only Actually, as in that ſtate: but the end of that was rather the Salvation of it; by ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward judgements reducing the offender to repentance. This <hi>Anathema</hi> upon the body by plaguing it, being miraculouſly inflicted, hath ceaſed. But yet not all bodily puniſhments with it, taking here bodily puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not only for bodily pains, but bodily and outward loſſes. Of this ſort may be thoſe ſeparate men from all Civil Communion with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, denying them all outward converſation, as well as ſpiritual, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. Now this ſeems to be a branch of the Old Greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and not in all places diſus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d. And ſometimes is unlawful, and otherwhile lawful, according to the extent and application of them. For, to inflict the ſame to the diſſolving of ties of nature, is not agreeable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55232:97"/>
to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel. And Natural Ties we call ſuch as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Subjects and Soveraign, Parents and Children, Husband and Wife, which by no Eccleſiaſtical Excommunication can be broken or nulled: The reaſon whereof, beſides the monſtrous effects enſuing upon their evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, not here to be treated of, is this, That Eccleſiaſtical Power can take away no more than it gave; nor Chriſtianity deſtroy what it never buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But Chriſtianity did never ſimply confer ſuch Rights on men, but the Law of Nature; only it regulated and directed the ſame, therefore can it not null it: It is therefore unchriſtian, for any pretending Eccleſiaſtical Power, to abſolve ſubjects from obedience Civil, or Children from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the like. But every Chriſtian in that he is adopted of God by baptiſm, and admitted into the Society of Chriſtians, doth receive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by certain Rights and power to communicate with it in all things: which power may be forfeited and loſt by breach of Covenant, as well with the Body of the Church, to live and believe according to the Received Faith and practice thereof, as with the Head Chriſt. And this being ſo judged by thoſe who are over the Church in the Lord, it is very conſonant to Chriſtian Religion, to deny ſuch, of what order or rank ſoever they be, the ſigns of outward communion, Prayer and Communication of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacraments of Chriſt. The Church hath power to declare even ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes uncapable of ſuch Communion, and deny it them: which we call the Leſſer Excommunication. Yet becauſe (as we ſaid) No natural Right can be extinguiſhed, upon unchriſtian miſdemeanours, If a Supream Prince of a Place ſhould diſdain to be denied or oppoſed in ſuch caſes, and would make his entrance into the Church by vertue of his Civil Right to all places under his Dominion, the moſt that the Church could do, juſtly in ſuch caſes, were to diſwade him, but by any force to reſiſt his entrance into any Church, were unlawful; as it would be alſo to miniſter in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian manner in his preſence: for this cannot be commanded by him: but in ſuch caſes ſuffering muſt be put in practice, as for the Faith it ſelf ſought to be deſtroyed</p>
                     <p>Some there are yet who call in queſtion the peculiar and incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right of decreeing this Cenſure of Excommunication, to thoſe called the Clergy: which is very ſtrange, ſeeing this Power is part of that of the Keys delivered by Chriſt himſelf to ſuch only as he conſtituted Governors of the Church; and that in Chriſts days their was a diſtinction between the Members of his Body, as to Inferiority and Superiority; Obedience, and Command; Teacher, and Learner; and much more in the Apoſtles days, after Chriſts Aſſention; and much more yet, after their days, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the matter of the Church (Chriſtians encreaſing and improving) became more capable of a more convenient form and faſhion. For as it is in the production of natural things, though the Form be certain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and the very ſame at the firſt production, as in its perfection, yet it doth not appear ſo fully and perfectly as afterward: So was it with the Body of Chriſts Church: It is certain therefore, that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this Act of Excluding from the Communion was never executed but by the Rulers and Preſidents of Congregations, though the people might concurr thereto. Now that theſe Rulers whom we may call Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were not created by the People, nor by the Prince, we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, and therefore did nothing in their Right, but in the Power of Chriſt whoſe Miniſters alone they properly were: And this being eſſential to right Adminiſtration of the Church, how can it be ſuppoſed either to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55232:97"/>
be ſeparable from the Church in General, or from thoſe perſons who are the proper Adminiſtrators of it. For to ſay with ſome, It is needleſs<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Selden de Jure Gentium apud</hi> Bibliander <hi>apud</hi> Eraſtum.</note> wholly where Chriſtian Magiſtrates rule, whoſe proper office it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and puniſh vice, and ſcandalous miſdemeanors; which, ſay they, can only be juſt cauſe of Excommunication; is to deſtroy the ſubject of the queſtion, which ſuppoſes it needful, and upon this, enquires after the Perſons which ſhould Execute the ſame. And ſpitefully to defeat the Church of all Authority from Chriſt; doth indeed tranſlate this Power to the Civil Magiſtrate. And is not the abſurdity the very ſame which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes the Chriſtian Governor with Civil Power, and which endows the Civil Magiſtrate with Chriſtian? If it be not abſurd for a King to be a Philoſopher, it is not abſurd for a Philoſopher to be a King. If it be not abſurd for a Civil Magiſtrate to have Prieſtly power, it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd for him that hath Prieſtly power to be a Magiſtrate. There is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no inconſiſtency on either ſide: For things of a far different nature and intention may eaſily meet in the ſame perſon, though the things themſelves can never be the ſame. Here therefore, the things differing ſo egregiouſly, it is no more than naceſſary that a different cauſe be acknowledged neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which not appearing, the Effect muſt be denied. Now the Cauſe of all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction as Eccleſiaſtical, muſt needs come from him, from whom the Church it ſelf hath its Original and being: And it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule that a man is born to nothing, that comes from Chriſt as Head of his Church, but is made and inſtituted. Which whoever is not, cannot lay any juſt claim to any Office under him.</p>
                     <p>I know it is objected, that Preaching being an Eccleſiaſtical Act, hath wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout contradiction been practiſed by diverſe, and to this day may be, no ordination preceeding. To which I thus anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing firſt between doing a thing <hi>Ex Charitate</hi> and <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> out of Charity and out of duty Preaching was ever permittedin the Church (eſpecially taken in the larger ſenſe wherein it ſignifies all declaration of the Goſpel) out of Charity: But the office of Preaching was never ſuffered, but upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent qualifications. And theſe two differ yet farther: For he that doth a thing out of Office, doth it ſo that it is not lawful for him abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to omit it: but he that doth it out of Charity and only by connivance, not by commiſſion, may ceaſe at his pleaſure, and as he made, may ſuſpend himſelf when he will. Again, he that teaches without Autority upon bare permiſſion, nay be ſilenced without any other cauſe renderd, but the will of him that hath the Juriſdiction: or if a reaſon be given, becauſe, He hath no autority, is ſufficient. But he that is orderly inſtituted to that end, cannot without injuſtice and Tyranny be denied the exerciſe of that which pertains to him.</p>
                     <p>Now the Key of Knowledge and the Key of Juriſdiction, of which the Power of the Keys delivered by Chriſt conſiſts, and into which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly divided, are very different. For the firſt doth but open the door to the others, and prepares and qualifies a perſon for the other, but doth no more actually give power or autority, than the great skill and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Souldier makes him a Captain, to command others: or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the law, makes a man a judge actually. It is therefore the Key of Juriſdiction or a Right given by Chriſt to adminiſter the Church, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very member thereof, that is principally to be acknowledged in this Caſe: And which not being found to deſcend orderly from Chriſt, no effect of that affected power can be acknowledged. But, as is ſaid, doth not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend

naturally, or by birth, but Judicially, from others. In which manner who ever receives it not, ſacrilegiouſly murps what belongs not to him.</p>
                     <p>But they who would wring this power out of the hands of the Church,<note place="margin">

But the ſame Antiquaries tell us alſo, that it was in uſe amongſt them for a man to excommunicate himſelf. And this I take to imply an anſwer to the former. For it is in the power of any man to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himſelf from the Church, or any other Society <hi>materially,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: but Judicially, and Formally, he cannot: neither can he ſeparate another, otherwiſe than by abſenting himſelf from the Communion of the Church: he may, indeed, as formally pronounce ſuch a cenſure againſt himſelf, or an other as the moſt Canonical Judge in the world; but intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique power being wanting, the outward Act turns to ſmoak, as to others; but as to himſelf, has no other effect then he that is in a boat hath upon the earth againſt which he ſets his oar, and thruſts hard, but puts himſelf off, not the earth: as our neighbouring Miniſters did when with intollerable and incredible preſumption, they took upon them to Excommunicate their own Biſhops; and ſome of the tranſmarine Churches of the ſame Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, were ſo wiſe as to allow their Fact.</p>

                     <p>And what we ſay of Excommunicating, holds good likewiſe in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Abſolution: which the ſame Perſons allow to meer ſecular Powers, and would prove from an Act of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great his abſolving <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia. Conſtantine</hi> (we all know) had but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Rites of the Church, at that time, and might attempt he knew not what, as ſoon as any other man, whoſe affection to Chriſtianity far exceeded his Judgement: But what is affirmed of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Act? That he Reſtored that Excommunicated perſon to the Communion of the Church: (which only is properly Abſolution) No ſurely, but he might reſtore him to his See, and that is all: Or if more were done, he might be ſaid to do it, who cauſed, by the interpoſition of his Power, ſome Biſhop of the Church to free him from thoſe Eonds.</p>
                     <p>But queſtionleſs that is none of the leaſt corruptions which the Church of Rome ſtands guilty of, and which our Church hath but too much conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, that the Power of Excommunication ſhould be in the hands of Lay men. To mend this a little, they of the Roman Law, diſtinguiſh that which by no means ſhould be ſeparated, curing one abſurdity by another:<note place="margin">Anastafius Germbnius de Sacrorum: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitat.</note> For they diſtinguiſh Epiſcopal Order, from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction: and ſay a man that hath not Epiſcopal Order, but Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, may Excommunicate: a vile and corrupt imagination brought in on purpoſe to ſerve the turns of ambitious, ſecular, and ſacrilegious <hi>Drones</hi> who
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55232:98"/>
would drive two trades, of ſecular advantage, and Eccleſiaſtical Profits. For there is nothing ſo Eſſential unto Epiſcopacy as Juriſdiction (I mean an Habitude and Right to Preſide and Rule,) and there can be no Epiſcopal power without that; nor that without Epiſcopal Charactar: Officers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there may be under him, void of that Charactar or any Prieſtly: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though the Court be properly Eccleſiaſtical, yet all things are not ſo which are acted therein. Judicial Acts, and Acts of Notaries and of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are competible to unordain'd perſons, becauſe Gifts of nature and Learning may capacitate a man to them: but that of Juriſdiction properly ſo called, is the intrinſique Right of the Paſtour of the Church: and this of Excommunication annext thereunto, or rather a part of it. And therefore, he is not a Biſhop, that hath it not, and he that hath it, is a Biſhop. It is not indeed neceſſary that this ſhould be denounced by a Biſhop, but that this power which is likewiſe inherent in a Prieſt as a Prieſt, be committed to him, after the decree made by the Biſhop. For the Prieſt having a Juriſdiction within himſelf, by vertue of his place and office, but reſtrained by the Superiour Power to him; the Juriſdiction and Autority of the Biſhop is ſeen ſufficiently in this, that it enables a Prieſt to do that which of himſelf he ought not to do: and this is rather exciting an old power in the Prieſt, then infuſing a new, giving right to it to exert it ſelf which before it had not. But Lay-men having no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Charactar inherent in them, cannot by any ſuch general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given them from the Biſhop, act effectually to that end for want of the due Principle: this Licence of the Biſhop being nothing elſe, but removing of that Obſtacle which hinders it to work where it was. For to deliberate, debate, and Judge of cauſes and perſons ſubject to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, may poſſibly be better performed by ſuch who have attained to that ſcience, without any order in the Clergy, but the fact it ſelf is quite of another nature.</p>

                        <p> Of the ſecond branch of Eccleſiaſtical Power, which is Myſtical, or Sacramental. Hence of the Nature of Sacraments in General. Of the Vertue of the Sacraments.

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving thus ſpoken of the Political Power of the Church, which we ſo call becauſe it imitates that which is ſo more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called in directing the viſible Body of the Church to its proper end, as the Pilot doth the ſhip to its proper Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and hath both Viſible Acts and Effects; We are now to treat of that Power, We, in diſtinction to that other, do call Myſtical: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the End and Effect thereof is not outward or viſible: but inward, ſpiritual, and Myſterious: and therefore alſo call it Sacramental, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Myſtery being the ſame in the Original Phraſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For to the Church, as they are more peculiarly called, who are Officers in the ſame, doth it, of Right, appertain to celebrate theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Wherefore, firſt we ſhall ſpeak of the Sacraments in General, as the manner is, and then in Particular.</p>
                     <p>The word Sacrament is rather of Gentile than Chriſtian original, there being no word in the New Teſtament proper to it, but the vulgar Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Sacramentum eſt inviſibilis gratiae inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis forma; ita ut ejus ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudinem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerat, et cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa exiſtat. <hi>Gulielmus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſiodorenſis.</hi> Sum.

The Nature, Number, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Uſe of them deſerving principal enquiry.</p>
                     <p>A Sacrament is defin'd (as is commonly known) by St. <hi>Auguſtine, a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign of an Inviſible Grace,</hi> which being taken rigorouſly, ſeemeth not to comprehend the whole nature of it: therefore <hi>Antiſſiodorenſis</hi> would have its defect ſupplied, thus. <hi>A Sacrament is a viſible form of an Inviſible Grace, whereof it is alſo the Cauſe.</hi> But conſidering the many and ſharp diſputes upon this ſubject, I ſuppoſe it may be more fully deſcribed to be <hi>A viſible ſign ordained by God to produce an inviſible effect of Grace in the ſoul of Man.</hi> This definition may be collected from the ſeveral parts of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the word of God: as firſt, from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans ſpeaking of Circumciſion, a prime Sacrament given by God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. <hi>And he received the ſign of Circumciſion a Seal of the Righteouſneſs</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>of Faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed.</hi> For there are three ſpecial properties of a Sacrament commonly acknowledged, To <hi>Signifie,</hi> To <hi>Seal,</hi> To <hi>Effect</hi> Grace: but in ſtrickneſs of ſpeech theſe make but two Acts. For, either a Thing doth barely ſignify and declare another, or it concurreth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55232:99"/>
to the being of another, where things are Related one to another. For ſeals are no more than ſigns binding more firmly to the fulfilling of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of an Inſtrument or Conveyance. For as in ſuch Caſes, the Free good will of the Donour, is the only cauſe of an inheritance given; the Inſtrument of Conveyance conſiſting of ſo many words are the ſigns of the inward will, the ſeals are but ſigns of the ſigns of words, that is, an aſſurance that what was ſignified in the ſaid Inſtrument, ſhould hold good. And the Actual Delivery of this is the immediate Cauſe of entring into poſſeſſion or enjoyment of this Gift. In like manner, The word of God promiſing his Graces to us, ſignifies the will of God to that end: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ſuperadded do likewiſe ſenſibly ſignifie unto us the earneſt God is in, when he made promiſes unto us, as Seals. And the actual exhibiting of theſe ſigns or ſeals on Gods Part by his Proxy or Miniſters, and the due receiving of them on our Part, do put us into a fruition of thoſe things which were ſo ſignified and promiſed. Firſt then, They muſt be a ſign, that is, a Repreſentation of a thing and not the thing it ſelf, and that to add to our knowledge and Faith: for if there were no agreement between the thing ſignifying, and the thing ſignified, the word of God alone had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to that end. Secondly, they muſt be ordained of God, For if no man, in common juſtice, can give away another mans eſtate, but the true owner of it; how ſhould it be poſſible, or equal, or credible, that any other beſides God himſelf the Owner of his graces, ſhould by inſtruments of his own forging convey ſuch heavenly benefits to mankind, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to God; This were ſupream folly and preſumption to attempt. Or can any man know Gods mind or methods of working before he hath revealed them? Therefore it is ſaid that God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> the Sign and Seal of Circumciſion. Thirdly, they muſt rather be ordained Arbitrarily of God, and by ſpecial Inſtitution, then Naturally; leaſt the Free Grace of God therein contained ſhould ſuffer, and the effect be aſcribed rather to natural than ſupernatural Cauſes. For though the cutting off of the foreskin of the fleſh, by explication, intimate the cutting off of the filth of the Soul: yet naturally it could not be ſo well underſtood: And God might, if he had pleaſed, ordained the cutting off of the tip of the ear, to ſerve the ſame ends. And ſo in baptiſm, Water doth naturally cleanſe bodily filthineſs, but without notice given of Gods will and grace, it could never have been believed poſſible to affect the ſoul, and purify it. Fourthly, as there muſt be ſome agreement between the thing ſignifying and ſignified, there muſt alſo be a real difference in their nature. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in nature or reaſon can ſignify it ſelf, becauſe nothing can be clearer than it ſelf: For when a thing is obvious to our ſenſes or otherwiſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<note place="margin">Sicut Signum et res ipſa a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquando poſſint eſſe diverſa, ita ſaepenumero et in multis eadem eſſe poſſunt: Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal. 9. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtia fol: 16.</note> we do not ſay, <hi>we have a ſign of ſuch a thing;</hi> but the thing it ſelf. Yet this moſt certain Rule is ſought to be bafled, and overthrown by Cavillers; who would bring in their falſe doctrine of the Euchariſt, and would ſhew from bread on a Stall or Cloath which ſignifies bread and Cloath as well as is bread and Cloath, that the ſame body of Chriſt may be a ſign of it ſelf. But their attempts in their Inſtance fail them becauſe that Bread which is expoſed to be ſold, or that Cloath, is not a ſign of it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is cloath or bread; but is ſo only: but it is only a ſign that either it is to be ſold, which is quite another thing from Cloath it ſelf, or it is a ſign of other cloath which doth not appear. And ſo the body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt is not a ſign of that Body which doth appear, but of that which doth not appear. And therefore, a Fifth condition of a Sacrament is, That it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55232:100"/>
ſhould <hi>viſibly</hi> ſignify ſomething inviſible and ſpiritual. Laſtly that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are to be not only ſignificant, or (which comes to the ſame) Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but efficacious in themſelves upon the ſouls of men: which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve further explication.</p>
                     <p>A thing may be ſaid in its ſelf efficacious, though it doth not attain the proper end of its working; it miſſes of its effect, becauſe the conditions required are not kept. For fire it ſelf, as active and operative an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it is, doth not work effectually upon any thing but its proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor upon that, at too great a diſtance. So may it be with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which though indeed they are the power of God, and not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unto ſalvation, yet through ſome defect in the object, or indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may fail of their proper and wonted Effect: but not from any inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in themſelves, or indignity of the Miniſter of them.</p>
                     <p>For, if in this ſenſe that old barbarous Rule be taken, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have their virtue <hi>Ex Opere Operato, viz.</hi> From the work done <hi>i. e.</hi> that they are Efficacious means of Grace in themſelves, and their vertue doth not depend upon the Miniſters unworthineſ, or worthineſs, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he doth work according to Chriſts inſtitution and intention, it is true: For what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is true of the Miniſters of the Sacraments, <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> The Officers of God in the delivering of theſe means of ſalvation not ſwerving from the Rule and Preſcription given by God, theſe Inſtruments themſelves have their due and proper effect. As when a King of his Free Grace ſendeth by a leud and vain fellow a Grant of ſome great Favour to any of his ſubjects, whom he pleaſeth to raiſe out of a poor and baſe eſtate to riches and honour, 'tis not the unworthineſs or wickedneſs of the bearer, ſo long as he is true in his Office, that can void the Grant, ſo neither can the evil manners of the Miniſters of the word and Sacraments, null the power and promiſes of God made in them.</p>
                     <p>But though evil manners and vitiouſneſs of the perſon do not corrupt or deſtroy the nature and end of the Sacrament, yet it is believed that the actual averſation of the mind of him who conſecrates and adminiſters, not only not intending actually to Conſecrate, but actually intending not to conſecrate, may evacuate the whole Action. But this is ſhown by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer example to be very falſe, becauſe ſtill God hath inſerted his will, and annexed his promiſes to the thing it ſelf, and not to the Perſons diſpoſition or indiſpoſition either of underſtanding, or manners. It is true, ſome of the Antients have ſaid that Intention is neceſſary to a Sacrament, and this hath given occaſion to that groſs Error in the Church of Rome; which hath miſtaken the intention of ſuch Fathers as have ſpoken of Intention. For Intention is twofold: The Intention of Chriſt or God, and the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man or the Miniſter; They may ſay that Intention is neceſſary to a Sacrament taking their Intention for the will and mind of God: which if it be not obſerved in all neceſſary thing, (at leaſt the Sacrament) is not perfect or valid: but if it be, whatever mans intention be, it hinders not, the Sacrament is the ſame. And whereas they would ſoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en this harſh, and moderate this erroneous doctrine, by diſtinguiſhing of Intention in the Prieſt, into <hi>Actual, Habitual,</hi> and <hi>Vertual:</hi> Firſt, we may well except againſt this diſtinction it ſelf, becauſe they are forced in the explication of it to make Habitual and Vertual Intention the ſame, in all material things, only they cauſe them to differ, in that, Habitual is only a general intention with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55232:100"/>
any actual conſideration at the time of Conſecration, of what they are about. Vertual, that there is at the entrance upon that Action, an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual purpoſe to do what Chriſt and the Church intended ſhould be done, at that time; but this paſſeth a way ſuddenly, and all the remaining Action is performed by vertue of that firſt good thought. But this cannot ſerve the turn; For the form of the Sacrament conſiſting chiefly in the words of Conſecration, according to their own doctrine, if ſuch an Intention be wanting at that time, there can be no conſecration, and if no conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no Sacrament. So that there are two notorious inconveniences follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Error; the one, that the moſt ſacred and Comfortable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Gods Grace and our Salvation are left to the luſts of maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vain man to be bafled at his pleaſure, and the Communicant defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the bleſſings God hath conſigned to him thereby. Another that upon ſuppoſition that the Sacraments were duly adminiſtred, and ſo by conſequence effectual to their proper ends; yet this being not certainly known to the Partaker thereof, his mind muſt be in perpetual diſturbance and conflict, fearing that the Prieſt had an inward intention contrary to the outward appearance. But they ſay, there is at leaſt a Moral certainty. And what is a Moral certainty? Can they tell? They have not yet. And all I ſuppoſe they can ſay is no more then to make it a good degree of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; which will not ſerve this Caſe. But in truth, many Caſes fall out ſo that there is that they call a <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> on the contrary: when ſpite and malice boll high in the breaſts of men, and their happineſs conſiſts in doing all the miſchief they can to them they malign, which we know by ſeveral Inſtances, is not ſeldom found in thoſe Countryes where this doctrine flouriſhes moſt: And to what they are wont here chiefly to oppoſe; That there can be no probability of an effect where the cauſe is not real but jocular, ludicrous, and Hiſtrionical (as it muſt be where there is no intention but only a fiction of doing a thing) as if one in mockery, upon the Stage, ſhould baptize one, in deriſion of the Faith and Church of Chriſt: We anſwer, That if this Ludicrous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be ſo fictitious, and falſe that the thing only ſeems to be done, but is not done; and one ſeems to be baptized, but is not: It matters not what his intention may be: For we now ſuppoſe the thing to be done as Chriſt and the Church intends. For if this be wanting, ſurely nothing is really performed: But the queſtion is whether when the thing is really done, ſaving the due intention, this defect voids all the reſt. For let an Officer of a King mock what he pleaſes, and act what he pleaſes in ſcorn and deriſion of the thing he hath in Charge to deliver, and declare it is contrary to his reſolution to deliver it, yet if he really doth deliver it, his contrary purpoſes and actions cannot hinder the effect, nor the benefit accruing from thence. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neither he that</hi>

                        <hi>planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth is any thing, but God who giveth the encreaſe.</hi> We ſee this in marriage more apparently than in other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (if we may call this a ſacrament, of which by and by) that, let the Miniſter intend what he pleaſes, nay the Parties Jeſt with that Sacred Rite never ſo lightly, if there be a performance of ſuch things as are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly required to that ſolemnity, it holds good to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even againſt the reſolutions of the perſons principally concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Yet muſt we acknowledge a vaſt difference between thoſe two moſt properly called Sacraments: Baptiſm, and the ſupper of the Lord. For undoubtedly, where in either of theſe there is a repugnancy of the will to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55232:101"/>
them, their effect is nothing upon the perſon receiving them: becauſe this is the principal obſtacle of all to the efficacy, yet is the Sacrament never the leſs valid, and, truly performed as to the Nature of it.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the Sacraments it is worth our enquiry; eſpecially for their ſakes who aſcribing very injudiciouſly and injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Grace of Sanctification and Juſtification abſolutely to a ſpecial Faith, thought of but lately amongſt Chriſtians; or to the unſearchable Decree of Almighty God, to juſtifie and ſave ſuch perſons as are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Life and Salvation, affirm this Decree and good purpoſe of God to effect all things neceſſary to ſalvation; and that the Sacraments are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only as ſo many pledges and ſeals of the good will of God in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Salvation, long before concluded immutably towards us; but are of no efficacy, or vertue to bring them about. This, though<note place="margin">Calvin. Cartwright. Perkins.</note> plainly and directly aſſerted by ſome eminent Reformers, is no better than a peſtilent Errour; contrary to all Antiquity of Eccleſiaſtical and Scriptural Writers: Of which latter, it ſuffices to inſtance in thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious places which directly inferra neceſſity of them, and aſcribe a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to them, of effecting, and not only ſignifying Grace, or ſealing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. For <hi>Matthew</hi> the 3. <hi>v.</hi> 11. St. <hi>John</hi> diſtinguiſhing his Baptiſm<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11.</note> from the Baptiſm of Chriſt, aſſureth, that Chriſt ſhould Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and not only with Water. Now if water alone ſignifies, or ſeals (for there is no ſuch great difference between theſe as commonly is ſuppoſed) and therefore the Baptiſm that Chriſt uſed having more in it than ſo, it follows that it muſt be the efficacy and grace of the Holy Spirit. And they, who take notice of this argument to anſwer, that the difference between <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm and that of Chriſt here propheſied of, conſiſts in this, That <hi>Johns</hi> was an outward waſhing, Chriſts an inward, doth confirm what I ſaid: For ſurely this inward, being inviſible, can be no outward ſign or ſeal, whoſe natures are to be viſible and apparent. And therefore it muſt be that Baptiſm of Grace wrought in the inward man. And doth Chriſt when he ſaith, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth, and is Baptized,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> doth he mean no more than, <hi>It is a ſign he ſhall be ſaved?</hi> Or he hath his ſalvation, which came onely by believing ſealed unto him? Or, are they not rather equally conjoyned to the ſame effect, Salvation? So that no more can a man expect to be ſaved by believing without being Baptized, than he can by being Baptized without believing. And this is manifeſt from the Baptiſm of Infants, which puts tham into a ſtate of ſalvation, even before actual faith in them.</p>
                     <p>Again, Being born of Water and the Holy Ghoſt, of which Chriſt<note place="margin">John. 3. 5.</note> ſpeaks in St. <hi>John</hi> (meaning thereby Baptiſm) muſt needs be more than certain indications and ſigns of life. Chriſt ſayes there expreſly, we are <hi>born by Water,</hi> and not that we are <hi>known</hi> to be born by Water only. And where as <hi>Calvin</hi> with diverſe followers of the Reformation, preſume to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this <hi>Water,</hi> as elſwhere <hi>Fire,</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, and not of the proper Element Water; I make no ſcruple to accuſe them of extreme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence for ſo doing; as well, becauſe they needleſly, and more immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly oppoſe the unanimous conſent of the Ancient Interpreters expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it of Water-Baptiſm, than I do contradict them, whom I alwayes ſet in a lower form to them: as alſo, becauſe the thing it ſelf declares the contrary ſenſe to be more agreeable to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt. For, Water and the Holy Ghoſt are put here, not <hi>exegetically</hi> (as they ſpeak) but diſtinctly as two ſeveral things concurring to the ſame end. For, though
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55232:101"/>
                        <hi>John</hi> in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> addeth to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Fire,</hi> as Water is in S. <hi>John,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 3.</note> ſeeing there is found a real and proper verification of this baptiſm of fire which was at the day of Pentecoſt, when the Apoſtles and Diſciples were viſited with fiery Tongues from above, there is no neceſſity of fleeing to a meer metaphor: and if there be none here, there is none in that place where water is joyned with the Holy Ghoſt: And reading no where, that even the Holy Ghoſt appeared in the likeneſs of water, we are conſtrained to take this properly, of external water.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, when an effect is aſcribed to a thing, why ſhould we make doubt to aſcribe an efficacie or agencie to that reputed Cauſe? But to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is aſcribed remiſſion of ſins, as <hi>Acts 2. 38.

                        <hi>and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. And elſewhere in the <hi>Acts,</hi> God commandeth St. <hi>Paul, Ariſe</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 22. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins.</hi> Can any thing but a fond partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the new gloſſes of Modern Divines, incline any man to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Baptiſm here, than of force to take away ſins? Here they demand with a Paſſion, What? <hi>Ex Opere Operato? From the work of Baptiſm done?</hi> I anſwer; The work done of it ſelf is not thus efficacious, as is ſaid; but the Co-operation of the Holy Spirit, which God hath ſet over that work, and its influence, effecteth thus much.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Introducers and Defenders of this opinion of the ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs of the Sacraments, allowing an efficacie to excite and nouriſh Faith, (which with them does all things) why ſhould they be ſo nice and timorous in granting another effect of the ſame nature? For to encreaſe and confirm Faith, being a ſpiritual effect, is as much in nature, as waſhing away ſins, or communicating new Graces? I ſee no difference, worth the noting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that from themſelves; and an illaudable pronity to vary from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition expounding holy Writ, where wit and wantonneſs of Judgment can find the leaſt footing to ſtand out againſt Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>But whereas ſome argue for the efficaciouſneſs of Baptiſm, and the other Sacraments out of Reaſon; and ſome out of Reaſon argue againſt it; it is hard to ſee how either ſide can attain their ends; ſeeing whatever efficacy the Sacraments have, they derive from the Inſtitution of God: which Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution can be no otherwiſe known to us then from his word, and therefore, as Divine reaſon proceeding upon Scripture grounds may inform us, we may conclude, and no otherwiſe: Wherefore they argue very prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and according to Scripture grounds, ridiculouſly, who talk of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quula,</hi> a Little water, as if for want of that God ſhould ſuffer a ſoul to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; or for want of a Little morſel of bread, and a drop or two of wine, men ſhould periſh everlaſtingly. As if it were not a mercy of God to ſave ſome, and that by the contemptibleſt things in the world, and ſuch as his illuminable power and wiſdom ſhould chooſe, rather than rigour in bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to them; or to be authours of our own ruin. But to protract a diſputation to prove that the efficacy of the Sacraments can ariſe from the Work it ſelf; thinking thereby that it muſt follow that they are not at all efficacious, as ſome very learned men have done, is rather to be pitied than perſecuted. For no otherwiſe do we aſcribe vertue to them, <hi>Ex opere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perato,</hi> but as it is oppoſit to <hi>Opus operantis,</hi> meaning that the inſtrumental things, the Sacraments, have not their ſufficiencie or efficiencie from the Inſtrumental Perſons, the Miniſters of them, but that theſe doing the work required of them by the Ordainer, the efficacie follows, and yet not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely from the work, but from the will of God.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the diſtinction of Sacraments into Legal and Evangelical. Of the Covenants neceſſary to Sacraments. The true difference between the Old and New Covenant. The Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Agreements and differences between the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MORE contention hath afflicted the Church of God in the diſquiſition of the number, than nature of the Sacraments. Firſt then, for methods ſake, We ſhall divide them into <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and <hi>Evangelical.</hi> Legal Sacraments were thoſe outward Signs and Rites which God ordained to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, as Inſtances and Notices of the Covenant made between him and them. And therefore it will not be improper nor unſeaſonable to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a little the immediate proſecution of the Sacraments, and treat of the Covenants God hath made with man, as well New as Old: ſeeing all the Sacraments, as well Jewiſh as Chriſtian, relate to thoſe Covenants.</p>
                     <p>A Covenant is nothing elſe but an Agreement ſolemnly made between two diſtinct Parties, with Conditions mutually to be obſerved: as in that between <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob, That the one ſhould not paſs over, that leap to the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 52.</note> 
                        <hi>other for harm.</hi> So likewiſe between God and Man, a Stipulation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulation is made that the one ſhould perform the part of a Patron and Lord, and the other of a faithful Servant to him.</p>
                     <p>This Covenant is but twofold in general, however it be diverſified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral occaſions of revealing the ſame. The firſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Covenant of Nature; the ſecond, of Grace. The Covenant of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was firſt made with <hi>Adam</hi> at his creation, wherein was beſtowed on him, not only ſuch Faculties and Perfections of Being as neceſſarily tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the natural perfection of man; but ſuper-added certain ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Graces which might diſpoſe him with facility to fulfill the Law and Will of God: Notwithſtanding which, he diſobeying God, forfeited thoſe more ſpecial aids and accompliſhments, and ſo diſſolved that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>God proceeded not upon faithleſs man according to the rigour of his Juſtice; but out of his free inſcrutable favour inclined to renew a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him again, and that was in a third Perſon, not with falſe man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as before. And this Perſon, through whom he thus covenant a ſecond time with man, was the Man Chriſt Jeſus: and then theſe three are no more Covenants really. Yet becauſe this ſecond, of ſending his Son as a Mediatour between God and Man, had ſuch different Forms and Faces
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55232:102"/>
upon it, according to the ſeveral Oeconomies or Diſpenſations it pleaſed God to make to man, it is often in holy Scripture diſtinguiſhed into the Old Covenant and the New: As by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Theſe</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>two are the two Covenants—The one from Mount Sinai; the other from Mount Sion or Jeruſalem.</hi> And to the Hebrews; <hi>If the firſt Covenant</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 8. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been found for the ſecond.</hi> Where he ſpake of the Covenant of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>But there was a more early Covenant made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> when God promiſed to him the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to his Seed: But both theſe agree in the ſame, in that they are tearmed Covenants of Works: not that they were ſo made that they only required working, and the ſecond part, believing, which was under the Goſpel: For this Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> peculiarly to the Iſraelites, did ſuppoſe the firſt ſolemn Covenant of Faith in the promiſed Seed of the Woman, which ſhould break the Serpents head: And therefore this was not another from that, but as a Codicil annext in order to ſome ſpecial Promiſes and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges made over to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon tearms not common to all mankind. Such as were temporal bleſſings, and particularly the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But that which is often called the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Covenant of the Goſpel, is according to the ſubſtance of an ancienter date than that made either with <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Moſes;</hi> being the ſame which was made with <hi>Adam</hi> the ſecond time in Paradiſe. But is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the New Covenant, becauſe it appeared but newly in reſpect of its dreſs and clearer revelation, at Chriſts appearing: And therefore St. <hi>John</hi> excellently expreſſes this, when he ſeemeth to ſpeak on both ſides, ſaying, <hi>Brethren; I write no new Commandment to you, but an old Commandment,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 7, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>which ye had from the beginning: the old Commandment is the Word which ye have heard from the beginning. Again, a new Commandment I write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, which thing is true in him and in you:</hi> ſignifying unto us in what ſenſe the Goſpel was new, and in what, Old. It was new in compariſon of the more conſpicuous manifeſtation of it: it was old in reſpect of its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. For to this end, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſpeaking of the Goſpel, calleth it the <hi>Myſtery which hath been hid from ages, and from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>but now is made manifeſt to his Saints, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the nature of this Covenant, and the vulgar confuſions made in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Old and New, will more clearly appear from a ſhort conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Agreement and Differences between theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
                     <p>And the firſt Agreement is that we now have inſinuated, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them both was the ſame. Secondly, they agree in their Author. For, contrary to ſome ancient Hereticks, the ſame God was the Author of the Old, who was Author of the New Law. Thirdly, they agree in the Principal Miniſter and Mediatour of both, which was Chriſt Jeſus: who is therefore ſaid to be <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> becauſe<note place="margin">Hebr. 13. 8.</note> both before the Law, and under the Law, and after the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt was the ſame Mediatour. Fourthly, they were one as to their end, which next to the ultimate of All, was the glory of God, was the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the obſervers of them: obedience unto Gods will being the moſt immediate. Fifthly, they agree, In that neither of them was immediately given of God, but both in the hand of a Mediatour between God and Man, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth of the Old Law, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>It was ordained by Angels in the hands of a Mediatour: Now this Mediatour
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55232:103"/>
is not a Mediatour of one:</hi> And of the Goſpel, the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that Jeſus was the <hi>Mediatour of a New Covenant:</hi> as was<note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 24.</note> propheſied in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying; <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren like unto me, unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> agreed in that, Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> came not of himſelf, but was ſent of God. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 5. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>not himſelf, to be made an High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> delivered their own will, or ſought their own glory, before the glory of him that ſent them. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to make all things according to the patern ſhewed<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 40.</note> him of God in the Mount. And we find nothing in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> more frequent than, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> In like manner, Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, <hi>The Word which ye hear is not mine, but the Fathers that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 14. 24. John 5. 43.</note> 
                        <hi>ſent me.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, they were both ſent immediately of God. Fourthly, Both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Doctrine by Miracles and mighty Signs, proving to the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a Divine Power aſſiſting them. For <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought ſuch Miracles as none of the experteſt Magicians could: and Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, <hi>If I</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 15. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>had not done among them the works that no other man did, they had not had ſin.</hi> Thus they may ſeem to agree.</p>
                     <p>But their difference is no leſs: and that, Firſt, if we conſider their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Authors in their Perſons. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was only Man, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> God and Man: under which one manifold, other differences are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, as to their conception, birth, life, and death; manner of their office and adminiſtration thereof; which I paſs over and come to the Laws or Covenants themſelves given by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For then the Law and Covenant in the hand of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was more ancient than that given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to the ſubſtance and foundation, which was the Law of Nature, and Reaſon, and Juſtice towards God and Man, and perfect Obedience to the will of God. For the Promiſe of the Meſſias to come, was made to Mankind immediately after <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, wherein conſiſted the ſum of the Goſpel, many hundred of years before <hi>Moſes</hi> his dayes, or Laws: and therefore muſt be more ſacred and neceſſary. Secondly, The Law as Moſaical was only a type and ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very things themſelves: as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> argueth.<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 1.</note> But as it is commonly ſeen when a man propoundeth to himſelf to caſt a fair Statue, or to build a fair houſe, he firſt makes a mold, and prepares convenient tools; So God, out of his wiſdom, (however he could have done otherwiſe) firſt prepared the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Model, according to which he caſt the Law of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and made uſe of the Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to prepare the way for the Goſpel. And hence ariſeth a Third difference, becauſe the Form of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law was temporary, and to ceaſe, but that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to have no end, as was propheſied in the Book of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſpeaking of the Jewiſh Politie, Church, and Magiſtracy, under the Metaphors of Heavens and their hoſt, as is freouent in Scripture, <hi>They ſhall periſb but thou ſhalt endure, yea all of them ſhall wax old like a</hi>
                        <note place="margin">pſal. 102. 26, 27. hebr. 1. 10. Jer. 32. 40. Hebr. 13. 20. Daniel 4. 3. Pſal. 145. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>garment, as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed: but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end.</hi> Of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there ſhall be no end. Fourthly, The Law and Covenant Moſaical had only temporal Promiſes of reward and puniſhments, relating to this Life and the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> called for this cauſe <hi>the Land of Promiſe,</hi> unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed upon condition of Obedience unto thoſe Laws
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55232:103"/>
delivered to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes:</hi> As upon due examination of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which may be given, doth appear. For they declare to us that ſo long as they obſerved Gods commands, and kept to his worſhip, they proſpered and were happy in ſecular bleſſings, but when they forſook them, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook them, and they ſoon periſhed in their ſins. But both the promiſes and threatnings of the Goſpel and New Covenant were ſpiritual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, leading unto everlaſting Life. <hi>For every one,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 29.</note>

Yet to judge more clearly of the Moſaical Law, and the better to reconcile both Jewiſh and Chriſtian interpreters of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, ſome whereof make it meerly Ceremonial, and concerning in its reward, only temporal bleſſings or curſes (as may be gathered from the bleſſings and curſes ennumerated in the Book of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note>

For the Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made by <hi>Moſes</hi> in Gods behalf, with the Iſraelites, contained in it many things of morality, and Gods worſhip and ſervice, agreeable to the ſubſtantial part of the Goſpel: but this it did not, <hi>as Moſaical,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>as Evangelical:</hi> For from the beginning of the World to the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, there was alwayes, as a thorow-Baſe to ſeveral parts in Muſick, the Covenant of the Goſpel in ſome degree running along with the various forms of Moſaical Conſtitutions, and theſe often inſinuated and preſſed in the Old Law: but the Covenant Moſaical, though it was built upon theſe grounds, was not faſhioned by them, but as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>had alſo Ordinances of Divine Service, and a worldly</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 1. v. 10.</note>

Now in all reaſon, the end ſhould be proportionable to the means. If therefore the means be carnal, ſo ought alſo the end: and not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſpeaking of the reward. But the Ordinances of the Goſpel being not Moral and Natural only, but Spiritual alſo, ought to have a ſpiritual or heavenly end. And as the reward upon Obedience, doth exceed that of the Law, ſo the ſeverity upon diſobedience: contrary to the too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Errour, that the Goſpel is more favourable unto ſinners than was the Law. For though indeed the ſame trivial neglects, or commiſſions as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Vide Chryſ. Tom. 6.

                     <p>Sixthly, The Law and Covenant made by <hi>Moſes</hi> were according to the Letter; but Chriſts, according to the Spirit. That was exacted upon outward terrours propounded, or Mercies: This, was tranſacted by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of Ingenuity and Grace given of God; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> is to be<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> underſtood: where he ſaith, <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you: For ye are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> meaning, That now leaſt of all, we ſhould let ſin rule over us, being not under the Law, that is, exempted from the penalties and terrours outward, which ſeemed to conſtrain obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or whoſe diſobedience was remitted upon certain outward Rites, which have no effect upon them who are under the Law of Grace. But the Grace of God ſo revealed outwardly, and ſo aſſiſting and inclining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, doth require more ingenuous obedience than formerly: as in the next Chapter it is ſaid; <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now from this adjuſtment of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in what ſenſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo oft calls one the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> and the other the <hi>Law of Grace.</hi> For he there takes not <hi>Law</hi> ſo generally as ſome would underſtand him, for all Rule and Doctrine of Holy Life, whereby they comprehend as well Evangelical, as Natural, and Moſaical, but in contradiſtinction to the Law of the Goſpel, publiſhed by Chriſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the Law, as it was Moſaical, according to which it could juſtifie no man: it being it ſelf to be done away in Chriſt. <hi>For</hi> (as the Scripture hath it) <hi>if perfection were by the Levitical Prieſthood (for under it the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the Law) what farther need that another Prieſt ſhould ariſe, after the order of Melchiſedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Anſwer from hence may be made to the difficulty, How far the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Old Law binds under the Goſpel? For having ſhewed that the Goſpel, in ſubſtance being ancienter than the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as well becauſe of the moral duties common to all mankind, as the Promiſes of the Meſſias contained in it; whatever we ſind in <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, or the Sacred Hiſtorians againſt any injuſtice, vice, or irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be imputed ſo much to the Law, as Moſaical, but as Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: And therefore, whatever was Levitical or Moſaical, in that Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, ceaſed and had its full completion in Chriſt. And though many things there found, were alwayes, and ſtill are of excellent uſe to all men, both morally and judicially taken, ſo that they cannot be ſaid to have no force upon us; Yet their obliging power, as delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not partaking of the nature of the Goſpel,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55232:104"/>
ceaſes, and is extinct; but lives, and is hinding as the ſame belonged anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to Chriſts Law, and by it is renewed and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The obſcurity at leaſt, if not errour, of thoſe Notes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction found in many learned mens writings, from hence is diſcerned: ſuch as are theſe. Firſt, That <hi>the Law</hi> propoundeth wrath, without Mercy: but the Goſpel, Mercy and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> For that the Law thus properly and preciſely taken, as diſtinct in matter, as well as form from the Goſpel propounded Mercies as well as Judgments, is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> though as we have ſhewed, neither the Mercy not the Judgments were of the ſame nature as they propounded by the Goſpel; but chiefly temporal: For whether the breach of any of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Laws, as ſuch made men obnoxious to Hell, and not only to bodily and temporal puniſhments, I much queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; unleſs we conſider the diſobedience formal, and doing preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, which may attend that evil act. Secondly, They ſay the Law<note place="margin">Perkins.</note> required <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>perfect Righteouſneſs;</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>imputed.</hi> But this is very dangerous Doctrine: For firſt, it doth not appear that the Law, as ſuch, and not partaking of the nature of the Goſpel, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch internal and perfect Righteouſneſs; it being ſatisfied with the outwardneſs and formality of the Letter. Secondly, It muſt not be granted that Chriſts Law doth not much more require internal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs, than the Law; and that to our Juſtification: For it is one thing to require a thing <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and another <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſibly to ſuch an end. The Goſpel doth require as abſolute Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous internal and external, as man is able to attain to in this world; and as the Law required, though nor ſo as if without it there were no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Salvation, though for want of it there be a merit of dammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the rigour is qualified and remitted to us upon the intuition of Chriſts merits, who interpoſeth for us, with God not to exempt us in any kind from any imaginable part or degree of Holineſs competible to us: but to mitigate, and remove the diſpleaſure of God juſtly conceived againſt us, for not being perfect. For it no wayes follows, That becauſe ſuch a ſmall proportion of Holineſs ſhall be accepted, and ſuch a vaſt proportion of wickedneſs ſhall be forgiven, and paſſed over through Gods free Grace in Chriſt, therefore by the general tenour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, God requires no more of the one, nor leſs of the other. For if the Goſpel be (as ſure it is) a more holy Law than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Is it not ſo becauſe it requires of thoſe under it greater Holineſs? A third difference I find is, That the Law promiſeth Life, upon condition of Works: but the Goſpel, upon condition of our committing our ſelves to Chriſt by Faith: This is very ambiguouſly ſpoken, and inclining to a very bad ſenſe. For what Life, and what works are we here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand? It is ſhewed above how ill-agreed wiſe Interpreters are, Whether any life beſides this preſent is promiſed by the Law, as Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and not Evangelical? and with this imitation I profeſs the Negative Part. Again, What works? Are we not to underſtand Works brought in and appointed by <hi>Moſes?</hi> To theſe works are promiſed indeed Life, anſwerable to thom; <hi>i. e.</hi> temporal, and no more? But he that ſaith, we attain Life by committing our ſelves to Chriſt by Faith, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly mean Life ſpiritual and eternal: which vaſt diverſity in the end and reward, quite nulls the compariſon. And beſides, how by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſelves to Chriſt? by Faith? So as that works of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55232:105"/>
and Faith ſhould be laid aſide? Yes, ſay they, as to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, though not to the commendation and approbation of our Faith: But the vanity of this we have already diſcovered, where we have proved, that there is no promiſe made to us under the Goſpel, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by Faith; that the works of Faith may not be as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to our Juſtification and Salvation as the Act of Faith, ſo much preſumed upon: and that the one is as derogatory to the fulneſs and freeneſs of Chriſts Grace and Gods Mercy, as the other, and no more. A fourth difference is, That the Law was written in Tables of Stone: but the Goſpel in the Tables of the Heart; <hi>Jerem. 31. 33. 2 Corinth.</hi> 3. 3. This hath a true ſenſe, and therefore may paſs, though lyable to juſt exceptions, as taking the Scriptures in a ſenſe ſcarce intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Fifthly, They ſay, The Law was inſtill'd into our Nature at our firſt Creation: But the Goſpel was above nature, and given after the <hi>Fall.</hi> But we are not to diſtinguiſh the part from the whole, nor the inchoation of a thing from its perfection. The Goſpel was in more particulars of agreeing with the Law of Nature, then the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and given in ſubſtance before the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and 'tis theſe two whoſe differences are ſought after at preſent. In the ſixth place, it is rightly ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediatour of the Old Law, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> of the New: by which they explain themſelves, That <hi>by Law,</hi> they mean, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law: For <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Mediatour of the Law natural, but <hi>Adam</hi> rather. And truly in the ſeventh place, it is ſaid, The Law was dedicated by the blood of Beaſts; but the Goſpel by the blood of Chriſt. But the concluſion to theſe, <hi>viz. That the two Teſtaments, the Law and the Goſpel are two in nature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and kind,</hi> is ſo far only true, as the Law is taken preciſely, for that introduced by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and not concretely and conjoyntly with that Covenant made between God and <hi>Adam,</hi> after his Fall.</p>

                        <p> Conſiderations on the Sacraments of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Of Circumciſion. Of the Reaſon, Nature, and Ends of it. Of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Reaſon why it was Inſtituted: Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>VVHAT is now ſaid of the nature and diſtinction of the Covenants made between God and Man, do ſerve much to the clearing of the Nature and Number of Sacraments here to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained briefly. For all Sacraments proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, are of a Foederal nature, between God and Man. And this covenanting made by God and Man, is ſigned, ſealed, and confirmed by theſe Sacraments: And therefore, according to the variety of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, is alſo the variety of the Sacraments; unleſs we except that moſt ancient Covenant of all, between God and Man, before his Fall. For while man retained thoſe connatural Graces beſtowed on him by God, he needed no ſuch outward helps, as Signs and Sacraments to contain him in due obedience to him, nor ſuch ſigns of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to him; being able to act more ſpiritually, freely, and perfectly then now. But upon the diſabling of his inward man by ſin once commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the hebetation of his mind, it was no leſs than neceſſary, that, by his outward ſenſes, occaſion ſhould be offered to the increaſe of his knowledge, fear, love, and faith in God: which is done by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments inſtituted by God: and theſe diverſified according to the variety of the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> it pleaſed God to uſe to the World. For under the Law of Nature (before <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi>) men ſtood obliged to ſerve and worſhip God: And in this condition the Sacrifices given to God, and Oblations, were of the nature and force of Sacraments: For whether by light of nature, or by ſpecial precept, men offered Sacrifice to God, it is apparent that was rather a ſignal to teſtifie their revering his Majeſty, and duty to him, than any actual abſolute worſhip: and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate an abſolute Dominion and Right God had to our own lives, in that inſtead of them which were forfeited to God by ſin, we offered Beaſts ſlain to him: and to all things in the World; in that was exhibited to him, ſo far as might be, and returned that which was received from him.</p>
                     <p>But to theſe before <hi>Abraham,</hi> was added that of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> and afterward that of the <hi>Paſsover.</hi> But we muſt note, that theſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as they were not originally, or from the beginning, inſtituted of God; ſo neither to all men, nor for all times: And this will appear from the particular occaſions taken, and reaſons rendered of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe his Son, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55232:106"/>
himſelf, and all the Males of his Family, it was no ſign at all of any thing of general concernment to mankind, or of the Meſſias ſimply, which was before promiſed; but it was a ſign only that the Meſſias ſhould proceed out of his Loyns, and Seed: which was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary honour and ſingular priviledge conferred on him. It was a ſign likewiſe, that his Seed were ſpecially choſen to Gods favour, to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that promiſed Land, and many other temporal bleſſings; which no wayes concerned other Nations. It might have likewiſe many other moral purpoſes which are ingeniouſly ſought out, and largely proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by others, and eſpecially <hi>Poſtillers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that many Nations obſerved this Rite of Circumciſion, but not by the appointment of God, nor by their own invention, but as tranſmitted to them from ſuch who either deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or received it from him. Neither was it to ſuch of the Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe not given them of God, and having no promiſes annext to that Act in them, but only as in <hi>Abraham.</hi> For the Covenant that God made with mankind, which we have call'd the Covenant of Works, in oppoſition to that of Faith, in Chriſt, made after the Fall, was made to <hi>Adam</hi> and all his, for ever, though all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> reaped not the like viſible benefit from it. And this ſecond Covenant received ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral additions according to the ſeveral Revelations, it pleaſed God to make unto ſome part of mankind above others; and that with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed: The firſt eminent Act of God was to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, when he gave him the Promiſe that the Meſſias ſhould deſcend from him, and gave him the ſign of Circumciſion, a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Faith which he had being uncircumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> Now what Faith was that which <hi>Abraham</hi> had before he was circumciſed? Not that which moved him to offer his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> to God, and yet believe that he ſhould inherit the bleſſings promiſed to him: but it was that Faith which he had in the more ancient and general promiſe with <hi>Adam,</hi> concerning the Meſſias. For otherwiſe, the Apoſtles argument to prove that we are juſtified by Faith, and not by works of the Law, would not hold good; which in effect is this. The ſame way that the Patriarchs, and particularly your Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified, the ſame way muſt ye be juſtifid too: but <hi>Abraham</hi> was not <hi>juſtified by the works of the Law, but by Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> And this appeareth plainly. For if <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified before the Law, and before Circumciſion, then ſurely Circumciſion and the works of the Law could not avail to his Juſtification. <hi>For how was Faith reckoned to Abraham for righteouſneſs? In circumciſion, or in uncircumciſion? not in circumciſion, but in uncircumciſion.</hi> And he received the ſign of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion as a ſeal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith he had being yet uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. From whence it appeareth, That what Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> by Circumciſion, was not abſolutely a new Covenant, but a ſpecial Priviledge, and Intereſt given to him in that long before, made with <hi>Adam</hi> after his breaking the firſt Covenant of Obedience and Works. And thus we ſee the nature and end of the firſt Sacrament given to the Jews before Chriſt, Circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond Sacrament of Note, was much of the ſame nature; as not being given to make an abſolute generally new Covenant with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but only to ſignifie the peculiar Right that People had to the general Covenants, above others; that as Gods Firſt-born ſons of all Nations, they ſhould have a double portion of that Grace, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55232:106"/>
otherwiſe to all. And farther, an addition of Temporal bleſſings was made ſure to them by it; upon the due obſervation of thoſe Rites and Laws given them: And this bleſſing was twofold hereby ſignified, Firſt, that paſſed, in delivering them ſo eminently and miraculouſly from the deſtroying Angel, who killed the Firſt-born of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and brought them from that tedious and grievous bondage, by which they were oppreſſed. And therefore it was called <hi>the Paſsover.</hi> The ſecond conſiſted in an Aſſurance of the promiſed Poſſeſſions in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now beſides theſe litteral ſignifications and ends, there were two other Spiritually intimated by them relating to the Goſpel, and its Services. And they were, the remiſſion of ſins in Baptiſm; and the right to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bliſs after death by the participation of the means of Salvation, the Mannah of his Word, and the Sacraments of his Promiſes, Baptiſm and the Holy Euchariſt.</p>

Matrimony, Penitence, or Repentance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and extream Unction: Of the latter ſort are Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55232:107"/>Now to underſtand the juſt reaſon of this diſcrimination between Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, it is neceſſary that we pitch upon ſome general Definition of a true Sacrament, by which as a Light, and Rule, the Falſe are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and judged. And therefore ſhall reſume our Definition before laid down of a Sacrament. <hi>A Sacrament is a viſible ſign inſtituted by God to produce an inviſible grace in the ſoul of man:</hi> which we have already defended.</p>
                     <p>But if men will religiouſly contend about words, it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That many of the Ancient and Holy Fathers, and the perpetual lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Church have accuſtomed themſelves to call many more things than Two, or Seven, or perhaps Seven times ſeven, Sacraments: becauſe they do contain ſomething ſacred and myſterious in them; but yet amount not to the perfection either of our received two Sacraments, or perhaps of the other five. And ſo long as men hold to the true and real Sacraments, and have the due uſe of them, it matters not much, if they give the Name<note place="margin">Praelect. de Sacram. Qu. 6. c. 1.</note> Sacrament unto thoſe things which are not worthy of it; as <hi>Whitaker</hi> hath well ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But the Reaſons againſt more than two Sacraments in the proper ſenſe, may be theſe. Firſt, That we read not of the inſtitution of any more than two, by God or Chriſt, in the New Teſtament; and of theſe two clear evidence there is found, as may more fully be ſeen, when we come to treat of them. Nay, according to the judgment of many of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, it was Chriſts intention we ſhould have but two Sacraments, when he ſhed from his Divine ſide, water and blood, inſinuating thereby Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Sacrament of his Blood. And another argument intimating<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> that Chriſt ordained but two Sacraments in the New Teſtament, is taken from the due conformity between the Shadows and Types of the Law, and the Subſtance of the Goſpel: The Law had but two Sacraments proper, Circumciſion and the Paſsover; and therefore that theſe two ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure only two in the Goſpel, is moſt probable. But not only the Fathers of old, but Schoolmen did alwayes acknowledge a due proportion to be obſerved between theſe. And it makes nothing againſt this, That the Fathers do often call ſome at leaſt of the other five, Sacraments; becauſe then they ſpoke at large, as we ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond general Reaſon may be, That as they have no precept, ſo have they no promiſe from Chriſt, of Grace or favour Spiritual. For Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation indeed hath an ordinary Gift of Eccleſiaſtical Power, but no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſpecial Grace belonging to it. Confirmation hath a good and laudable end, but no ſpecial Promiſe to it. Repentance hath a promiſe, but hath no outward viſible ſign, upon which the word is built, to make it a Sacrament: for this is a</p>
                     <p>Third Reaſon of the equality of Sacraments, Becauſe all true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacraments muſt conſiſt as well of outward ſigns, to which the word and Grace are annext, as of the Grace it ſelf therein given. But all theſe Sacraments have not theſe Signs, and they which have an appearance of viſible ſigns, have them not by Gods inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Sacraments of the Goſpel are of concernment to all true Chriſtians, according to their Capacities: but all Chriſtians are not, by the confeſſion of the Patrons of ſeven Sacraments, bound to marry, or to be in Holy Orders. Nay, ſome are abſolutely interdicted the uſe of ſome of the reputed Sacraments, as are women from Holy Orders; therefore, whatever may poſſibly be ſaid concerning the not circumciſing of Women
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55232:107"/>
under the Law, under the Goſpel there being neither Male nor Female, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, that cannot be a Sacrament equal in ſacredneſs, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of which Women are not capable.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The general Nature of Sacraments is ſuch as renders the due Partakers of them more holy than they are, who receive them not: but no man ſaies that marriage faithfully obſerved doth make any perſon more holy then Virginity, therefore it cannot be a Sacrament: If they here ſay, That Marriage is not a Sacrament abſolutely, but only as it is Chriſtian, and a repreſentation of Chriſts conjunction with his Church; and as it is bleſſed by the Prieſt. I anſwer, Firſt to this latter; That <hi>bleſſing</hi> doth not alter the kind of the thing, but only ſanctifies the thing it ſelf: and therefore Marriage in Heathens and Chriſtians is the ſame in nature; but not in the circumſtances of Holineſs. And whenas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> having before treated of ſolemn Marriage, <hi>This</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 31, 32</note> 
                        <hi>is a great myſtery:</hi> from whence commonly is drawn an argument of a Sacramentalneſs in Marriage of Chriſtians; the reply is eaſie, which quite nulls the concluſion. Firſt, Becauſe it is as manifeſt as a thing need be, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeak rather of Heathens marriage than Chriſtian, as appears from his citation of the firſt inſtitution of Marriage, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all: and therefore according to themſelves, could not intend to make a Sacrament of it, ſeeing it is no Sacrament, but as Chriſtian. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The word being <hi>Myſtery,</hi> doth not properly ſignifie a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however the Vulgar Tranſlation might be allowed to tranſlate it ſo; but not men, upon that tearm given at large, to draw it into the number of Sacraments. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians, Behold I ſhow you a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>we ſhall not all dye, but we ſhall all be changed.</hi> Is this a Sacrament alſo? But many of the Fathers have ſo called it. It may be ſo, in the ſenſe before ſpoken of, in which many more things may ſo be called. But laſtly, The Apoſtle in that Place to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> doth expreſly remove that tearm <hi>Myſtery</hi> from the natural or civil conjunction of Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 27, 29.</note> in Matrimony, and reſtrain it to Chriſt and his Church; and doth not ſo much as ſay that Marriage is a myſtery. For having drawn an Argument for the due obſervation of Wedlock and its Rights; that ſeeing Chriſt loved his Church, man ſhould love his Church; he addeth afterward, <hi>This is a great myſtery: but I ſpeak of Chriſt and the Church:</hi> which is as<note place="margin">32.</note> if it had been ſaid, Here is a great Myſtery; but this Myſtery I mean not. So much of external Marriage, but internal, between Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                     <p>But after all this, ſeeing we grant with many of the Ancients, That the name Sacrament is communicable to more than two, it is not much worth the contending, whether we make more or fewer than ſeven; while, we reſerve a peculiar ſacredneſs to theſe two above others. Let us rather touch upon them in their nature, than name; as beſt worthy to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of Orders briefly, as having ſpoken thereof in treating of the Political Power of the Church, and there ſhown the neceſſity of them according to Chriſts intention and inſtitution; which was to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination between Perſons, and the ſeveral Members of that Body, the Church, of which he is the Head; as is alſo ſufficiently inſinuated by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying; <hi>But now hath Göd ſet the Members every one of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>them in the Body as it hath pleaſed him:</hi> where he doth not ſpeak of moral, but Political excellency, and order of Inferiour and Superiour: From whence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55232:108"/>
the name of the Function is taken. For as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defines it, <hi>Order is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Civ Dei. Lib. 19. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>the diſpoſing or ranking of equal and unequal things in their proper places.</hi> And therefore ſometimes the Church is divided by the Ancients into Clergy and Laity, as two Orders. Again, The Clergy by the Ancienter into three only, Biſhop, Prieſt, and Deacon, as <hi>Optatus.</hi> Afterwards ſome made<note place="margin">Iſidorus Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpalens. Orig. Lib. 7. c. 12.</note> ſix, ſome ſeven, ſome nine, as <hi>Hiſpalenſis,</hi> who likewiſe ſubdivideth the Biſhop into four Orders, Patriarch, Metropolitane, Arch-Biſhop, and ſimple Biſhop. So that it were not worth the labour to ſtrive about words here; and eſpecially in diſtinguiſhing <hi>Order</hi> from <hi>Degree</hi> in the Church. For though the diſtinction in nature be manifeſt between the firſt importing a diverſity in kind, and the other in condition of the ſame kind, yet the Church cannot be though to ſpeak ſo circumſpectly at all times, and ſo preciſely, as not to uſe them promiſcuouſly divers times; ſo that becauſe ſhe ſometimes ſpeaks of Degrees, they ſhould deny the Order of the ſame thing. Neither are we to mutiny againſt the Conſtitutions of Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, which in progreſs of time, added ſome inferiour Orders to thoſe moſt anciently received in the Church; <hi>viz.</hi> of Biſhop, Prieſt, and Deacon: For I take it to be no invaſion of Chriſts Right, to call to the aſſiſtance of ſuch as he had conſtituted, ſuch as he did not ordain to that end: but to retrench of the number, to diſſolve that Order which he appointed, that is ſacrilegious. What then may we call Orders, but <hi>The Collation of an Eccleſiaſtical Faculty or Power to ſerve God and the Church, by ſuch as are authorized by God, uſing the neceſſary Forms of Words and Rites thereunto required, according to his order of Miniſtration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we have already ſhewed, That as no man can create himſelf a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, neither can he an Eccleſiaſtical Officer: and as no man in that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litv can be created but by one in Authority rightly derived to him, ſo can none in Spiritual matters be ordained to Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtration, but he that is thereunto called by ſome in Lawful, or at leaſt, real Power: And therefore ſuch who are choſen and appointed by the common people, are but common people after ſuch vainly affected callings: and they who are of an inferiour Order were never acknowledged to have power to create one of a Superiour to them: As it was never endured in the Church till of late dayes, that Prieſts ſhould appoint Biſhops or Prieſts: becauſe, though Power of the Keys were communicated to them, in reference to the two Principal and neceſſary Sacraments; yet never as to the whole complex notion of the ſame, which conſiſts of Juriſdiction, as well as Knowledge and Interceſſion. And the School argument, which at leaſt, hath given occaſion to confound the Order of Biſhop and Prieſt is very falſe and frivolous: ſuppoſing all Eccleſiaſtical Orders to be ſo denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>in or dine ad conſecrandum</hi> from their relation to the Power of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt; becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that to be the ſupream Myſtery and End of Prieſtly Office; but the diſtinction of Power Political and Myſtical in the Church quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws that: For the Power of Juriſdiction is greater in its kind, than that of celebrating, and therefore not ſo vainly to be taken. Again, the Orders of the Church are ſo called from the Relation they have to the Body Eccleſiaſtical, or outward Form and Conſtitution of it; which is made up of all of them by a gradual aſcent, from the loweſt to the higheſt; which make that Hierarchy, without which a Church has but very little to ſhow that it is a Church, but is forc'd to ſhroud it ſelf under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure priviledges of being an inviſible Church, though not viſible Orders
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55232:108"/>
therefore thus duly adminiſtred, though they be not a Sacrament (for then muſt there be ſeven Sacraments ſubordinate to the other famous ſeven; becauſe generally ſeven ſorts of Orders are adminiſtred in the Church) yet are they Sacramental things, that is, Sacred, and no leſs neceſſary to the conſtituting a Viſible Body of Chriſt than are the others to the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And though that cannot preſently be concluded to be a true Church of Chriſt which hath them, I do not ſee how that can be a true Church which hath them not.</p>
                     <p>And for that which is commonly called Extream Unction, being the Anointing of the Infirm of Body, or ſuch as are deſpaired of, as to this Life: I ſee no great matter to be objected againſt it, no more did <hi>Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Bucer,</hi> nor ſome other eminent Reformers for a good while after they left <hi>Rome;</hi> provided it be done with that ſolemnity and ſoundneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of God, and Benediction of the deceaſing Party as may comfort and ſtrengthen him in his laſt Agonies: It being ancient, though not ſo old as is pretended, nor miniſtred in the ſame manner, as now. For in the beginning, not one, but many Presbyters of the Church were called according to the advice of St. <hi>James,</hi> to pray over the ſick, and to anoint<note place="margin">James 1. 14, 15</note> him with common, not compounded, or artificial Oyl, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miraculous event. But becauſe the Miracle is now ceaſed, it is no good reaſon the thing it ſelf ſhould be deteſted. For Primitively a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle did accompany Baptiſm too, which ceaſing, no man will declare the Sacrament it ſelf ought to ceaſe likewiſe. The Superſtitions of Prayer and ſome other Rites added of late, whereby the ſimplicity of it hath been corrupted, is a more reaſonable ground of laying it down: Neither is the want thereof in that formality to be charged upon a Church, where there is commanded and continued due Miniſtration to the Sick, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the neceſſities of Body and Soul. But though the uſe hereof be ancient, yet the name <hi>Sacrament</hi> hath not ſo anciently been aſcribed to it, in the ſenſe at this day Current. And <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt, who is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have ſo called it, doth permit others beſides Prieſts to miniſter the ſame to the Sick, the Chriſm or Oyl being made by the Biſhop.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT of <hi>Confirmation</hi> much greater eſteem hath ever been, and ought ſtill to be had; though not ſo much as ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and divers Modern Schoolmen would exalt it to: unleſs a favourable interpretation be made of their judgments deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered concerning it. For they make it more uſeful than Baptiſm it ſelf: and impute the efficacy of Baptiſm in great part unto this Sacrament. To judge the better of which Opinion, it is to be conſider'd what this Confirmation is. Confirmation may be ſaid to be a ſolemn Act of Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and Benediction of a Perſon upon his publick Profeſſion of that Chriſtian Faith into which he was before baptized. Firſt, It was required that the Perſon capable of this Ceremony, ſhould have firſt been baptized: For he was not hereby made a Chriſtian, but, as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, confirmed in that Faith, into which he had been baptized. And the Reaſons hereof were ſuch then as do to this day commend exceedingly the uſe of it; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe ſome were baptized in their minority or infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when, wanting common judgment, they could not diſcern the nature, uſe, and end of Baptiſm: and therefore very requiſite it was that they ſhould after due and ſober information in the myſteries and principles of Chriſtian Religion, make in their own perſon ſuch a publick Profeſſion of the ſame as they were bound to do at the time of their baptiſm; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">

We that are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and inſtructed in the Faith of Chriſt, ought to profeſs the ſame in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and clearly in the Church, ſeeing we could not do this, when we were baptized. Maſt.</hi> How are ye confirmed? Schol. <hi>By publick bleſſing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Church, with impoſition of hands. Maſt.</hi> But how art thou aſſured of this? <hi>Schol. We have Word of God, when he ſayes, Let little Children come unto me, &amp;c.</hi> Thus that Catechiſe. Another reaſon may be the danger from the multitude of Hereticks which poſſibly might have corrupted ſuch young beginners in the Faith, therefore, as well for the better ſecuring ſuch perſons, as for the ſatisfaction of the Church, that they who were once enter'd into communion with it, did ſo perſevere inviolate in the ſame, this excellent Rite was inſtituted. And ſurely, becauſe it notably diſcriminates Schiſmaticks and Erroneous perſons from ſober and faithful Members of Chriſt, and his Church; it is by vain, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and ungodly perſons ſcoffed at, railed at, and contemned. A third
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55232:109"/>
Reaſon reſpecteth the time to come, wherein a man foreſeeing the many and great temptations of the World, Fleſh, and Devil, which he had renounced in Baptiſm, to increaſe upon him, as he converſes more with the World, doth thereby fortifie himſelf by a renewed profeſſion of his Faith and Obedience to Chriſt. Fourthly, to this conduceth very much the Benediction of his Ghoſtly Father, the Biſhop, and the joynt prayers of all the Congregation, which ought devoutly to be put up to God for the deſcent of his Grace, to preſerve the perſons ſo confirmed in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſion: which ſhould be moſt earneſtly deſired by every pious heart that likes his Religion, and fears his own frailties. And it is to me an infallible argument of deſperate unchriſtian prophaneneſs, or a new ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition inſtilled into men, alienating them from the truth of that Religion in which they were educated, who carp at this ſo godly Conſtitution: their beſt ground being that which is to all their frivolous reaſonings, Becauſe no expreſs place of Scripture commands it directly: and becauſe it is poſſible to be ſaved without it: It is poſſible that we may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many things which we daily uſe in Religion; and yet they contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and wilfully omitted, may be a juſt and certain cauſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: the Scriptures having not limited God to thoſe means of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, which they have, if we would be ſaved: And yet again, they have not ſo particularized our duties, that there ſhould be nothing accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God from us which they have not expreſſed. I find it diſputed on both ſides, whether this Rite be of Divine Inſtitution or not: and ſhall not determine it: but in this both Ancient and Modern, Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches are agreed that it is of Divine uſe, and therefore I may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it to be pious and profitable; and them who oppoſe it, to <hi>ſpeak evil</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>of the things they underſtand not,</hi> for which they may utterly periſh in their own corruption,</p>
                     <p>But I ſuppoſe the proper Miniſter of this Solemnity, who alwayes was the Biſhop of the Church, hath much turned the ſtomach of thoſe who very unhappily have none; or moſt wickedly endeavour to have none, againſt it. For conſidering how little is to be ſaid againſt it, how much for it, the principle ground why they are bent againſt it, muſt be to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from notorious defects. To underſtand this, as likewiſe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performing this Sacramental Rite, it is to be noted, there was a threefold uſe of Unction, called alſo <hi>Chriſm,</hi> in the ancient Church; whereof one pertained to the Presbyter or Prieſt: who in the time of Baptiſm was wont to anoint the party baptized on the crown of the Head. The other two were properly belonging to the Biſhop, the one being done preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Hieremias Patr. Cap 7.

In <hi>Gregory</hi>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55232:110"/>
ſolemnity: our Churches moderation endeavouring to prevail upon the modeſty of ſome diſſatisfied perſons in it, have incurred the cenſurre of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, in paring that Ordinance to the Quick from unneceſſary excreſcencies, without any effect upon her own undutiful children, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy and petulancy, in their private moroſities, which at length may teach us, how vain ſuch charms of Charity are uſed upon ſuch deaf Adders, and unnatural Vipers: whom nothing will ſatisfie but the tearing to pieces the womb that conceived them. And that they may do with it what they liſt, they make the Church ſpeak what they liſt, many times. And therefore, though it hath wiſely declared, and plainly, but for two Sacraments, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily neceſſary to ſalvation, they are wont to exclaim againſt it; thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring contumeliouſly that ſhe holds more, though not ſo neceſſary: which had been no ſlander, if they at the ſame time had uſed that candour which became them in ſtating the mind of the Church, as they might, and ought: but to do this here, or in other caſes, were to do themſelves or Cauſe wrong; and to be juſt to us, were to be cruel to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>A fifth pretended Sacrament is that of <hi>Repentance,</hi> ſometimes alſo called <hi>Penance</hi> with us: For ſo I read Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> in his Sermon on the Fourth of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the ſeventeenth, to ſpeak, ſaying; <hi>Penance is a ſorrowing or forethinking of our ſins paſt: an earneſt purpoſe to amend, or turning to God with a truſt of pardon.</hi> Which deſcription may ſuffice us at preſent. For the firſt thing in Repentance is a ſound judgment of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of the Facts committed or omitted; the next is a belief and ſenſe of the evil of puniſhment incurred by ſuch enormities: A third degree or act of the mind is a change of the reſolution for the time to come, to act more reaſonably and faithfully. A fourth is an apprehenſion of the Grace and Mercy of God towards him upon his humiliation and return. A fifth the real execution and putting in outward practiſe the good purpoſes of heart, in effects proper to Repentance. A ſixth is not to repent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or return to the offenſes for which he was ſo grieved: and which he renounced. A ſeventh is the fruits on Gods part ſignifying his favour towards ſuch truly penitent Perſons by the comfortable teſtimony of his Spirit of Grace, in their Conſciences witneſſing the remiſſion of ſins, and reconciliation to God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Parts of Repentance are commonly made theſe three: <hi>Contrition, Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> which to ſpeak properly cannot ſo be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: For of all theſe only Contrition is of the very nature of Repentance: but Confeſſion and Satisfaction, to which we may adde Reformation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, are rather the Effects than Parts of Repentance: but theſe two are never the ſame in proper language. And therefore in vain do they go about to juſtifie that deſcription as proper, of Repentance, which both <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> do give us; That it is ſuch a change which committeth not the ſame things again. And, an act whereby we lament ſins paſſed, and commit not ſins to be lamented. There can be nothing done more indiſcreetly againſt a mans ſelf, or injuriouſly againſt the Fathers, than to make every true ſaying of theirs a definition: or to deny them the liberty of their Rhetorical pen ſometimes, when they write what is true, though not ſo accurately, as the laws of Logick may require. If we miſtake not, this abuſe of the Fathers hath done great miſchief in the Schoolmens works, and eſpecially <hi>Thomas</hi>'s, as may appear in his Summes, where a bare and ſecure aſſeveration of ſome Father, is taken for a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55232:110"/>
very ſufficient definition, and turns the controverſie quite another way, then reaſon according to Scripture would have it go. We all know that the Fathers, as all other Writers, even the Scriptures themſelves, ſpake not alwayes Definitions: and the Definitions they gave were not alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules and Practiſe of Logicians, but Rhetoricians; with whom it is moſt frequent to deſcribe a thing from the proper and moſt commendable effect. If a man ſhould ſay he is a Souldier indeed, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yieldeth till he hath gotten the victory, ſhould ſpeak very true: but this were no true definition of a Souldier: For a Souldier may looſe the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And ſo Repentance is that which repeateth not former ſins before ſorrowed for, but this doth not prove that to be no repentance which cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a man returns to his former evil courſe; or that repentance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd in which was broken off, might not have carryed him to heaven. For who knows not that all habits moral, and graces ſpiritual, (ſuch as are Faith and Repentance) have their proper ſeat in the inward man, affect the mind and heart immediately, and from thence are known primarily and deſcribed? Outward acts are but the effects: and the effects may illuſtrate, but cannot be of the eſſence of the Cauſe. Therefore Repentance exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered is nothing more than a thorow change of the mind and heart from things contrary to Gods will, and to the obedience of the ſame. This is true repentance; and if it be not effectual, it is becauſe it is not, that is, perſeveres not in that good nature. It were ridiculous to ſay, A man never went towards <hi>London,</hi> it was no real motion, becauſe he turned back again, and never came at that place. And no leſs, that a man never truly repented, becauſe he gave over, and reaped not the fruits of Repentance. For the nature of Repentance might be the ſame, though vaſtly different as to the end. Once true Grace, and alwayes true Grace, ſay they: but what word of God, what judgment of the wiſeſt and holieſt Chriſtians have they to bear witneſs to their preſumptuous aſſertion? Their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is too inconſiderable, and their argument moſt vain which is taken from the event; and begs the queſtion when they thus talk, If it be true Grace it will perſevere; and if it perſevere, it is true: So that give the higheſt inſtance that ever was, or any mans mind can imagine poſſible to be, of Grace, which failed: they anſwer very ſafely, (if as wiſely) It was not true, for it faild. But this is no place to argue this point.</p>
                     <p>We except not againſt the things themſelves in Repentance, Contrition, Confeſſion, Satisfaction, but againſt the order they are ſet in: though Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> that holy and learned man, ſticks not at that accurateneſs in his former Sermon, ſpeaking thus: <hi>We ſay penance hath three parts, Contrition, if you underſtand it for an hearty ſorrow for ſin: Confeſſion, if ye underſtand it for faith of free pardon, in Gods mercy by Jeſus Chriſt: and Satisfaction, if you underſtand it not to Godwards—but to Manwards, in reſtitution of things wrongfully and fraudulently gotten, of name hindred, by our ſlaunders; and in newneſs of life.</hi> And <hi>Perkins</hi> makes our conſent with the Roman<note place="margin">Perk.

                     <p>
                        <hi>COmpunction</hi> is a general word comprehending <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Attrition,</hi> the proper parts of <hi>Repentance:</hi> and according to <hi>Bernard,</hi> is an humiliation of the mind proceeding from the remembrance of ſin, and the fear of Gods Judgment, &amp;c. But<note place="margin">Bernard. de modo bene vivendi, Serm. 10.</note> if we take Compunction generally, it may be rather deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed An humiliation of mind proceeding from an apprehenſion of the Evil of ſin. Now the Evil of ſin being twofold, doth divide this Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into two kinds, <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Attrition.</hi> Contrition being, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt received diſtinction of it from Attrition, <hi>A ſincere and hearty ſorrow of mind, upon the ſight and ſenſe of the Evil of ſin, in it ſelf, and the offence thereby committed againſt Almighty God his goodneſs chiefly:</hi> But there is another miſchief in ſin, and that doth principally concern the Offender himſelf, who thereby having violated Gods moſt juſt and holy Laws, and incurred his diſpleaſure, has made him ſelf obnoxious to the curſes denounced againſt the breakers thereof: and therefore is a <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conſcience conceived upon the apprehenſion of Gods wrath juſtly due to him, and impending over him.</hi> Theſe, by ſome, are made not only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (as in truth they are) but contrary too: ſo that Attrition ſhould be rather an addition to former Guilt, than a method of evading Gods wrath, and being reconciled unto him: and their reaſon is, becauſe it is not done in Faith: Hence they diſtinguiſh between <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">Perkins.</note> making the former quite diſtinct from the latter, and oppoſite to it. Legal contrition, ſay they (which is Attrition) is nothing but a remorſe of Conſcience for ſin in regard of the wrath and judgment of God, and it is no grace of God at all, nor any part, or cauſe of Repentance, but only an occaſion thereof, and that by the mercy of God: for of it ſelf it is the ſting of the Law, and the very entrance into the Pit of Hell. Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contrition is when a repentant ſinner is grieved for his ſin, not ſo much for fear of Hell, or any other puniſhment, as becauſe he hath offended and diſpleaſed ſo good and merciful a God. This Contrition is cauſed by the Miniſtry of the <hi>Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> In this vulgar account of Attrition and Contrition, or the two Parts of Contrition, Legal and Evangelical, is a twofold errour committed, not to be paſſed lightly over. The one is a rude and common miſapprehenſion of the ſtate of the Goſpel, as if it were all made up of Mercy, and conſiſted not at all of Juſtice and Vengeance to be executed upon ſinners breaking the Law of the Goſpel: but whatever
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55232:111"/>
we can reaſonably ſuppoſe of mercy, muſt be owing altogether to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: but if any threatning, and ſeverities of Juſtice be feared, that muſt be borrowed from the Law. And what Law I pray do they mean? The Old Law, I doubt not. But the Law before Chriſt had its moralities or perpetual Duties, and its Moſaicalneſs which was tranſient, and is now actually ceaſed, as all the Obligations and Penalties belonging thereto. It cannot be that then which moves to this Legal Contrition: but if any thing, the moral and perpetual part, conſiſting of Juſtice and Equity, which are no leſs an ingredient into the Goſpel than into the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. And, becauſe there is nothing more abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than to have a Law conſiſting of juſt and holy Precepts and Rules: which ſhall not alſo conſiſt of proportionable Rewards of the Obſervers and Breakers thereof; returning as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us at large in his Epiſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the Jew and to the Gentile doing well, <hi>honour and glory; and ſhame and wrath to the evil doer:</hi> ſpeaking of the preſent ſtate of the Goſpel. And we have before ſhewed, That ſo far is the Goſpel from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up of all mercy, that the judgments and puniſhments therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt Sinners, are more grievous than they in the Law: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Goſpel is called a <hi>Book of Good tidings or News:</hi> not becauſe the Sinner impenitent ſhall ſind any more favour, or ſo much as he might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Law; but becauſe the Salvation here publiſhed is of greater extent, comprehending all Nations and ſtates of men; which the Law did not: And alſo offering full and free means of Repentance, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God through Chriſt, and a treaſure of Grace, as well to aſſiſt in the performing of the condition of the Goſpel, as to pardon and remit what is committed againſt it, upon humiliation and repentance. So that the Goſpel has a Legal part (as the phraſe is) and Evangelical: And the terrours of the Goſpel or Legal Part of it have juſt influence upon the Conſciences of men to humble and affright them, though there ſhould be<note place="margin">O Soror, nulla res ſic nos ab omni peccato cuſtodit immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſicut timor inferni et amor Dei. <hi>Bern. de modo bene vivend.

                        </note> no ſuch thing extant as the Old Teſtament: and therefore the Attrition of a Sinner under the guilt and ſenſe of his ſins, is much more an effect of the Goſpel than of the Law. And therefore is not ſo the entrance into the Pit of Hell, as if directly it lead to Hell: For 'tis ſecurity and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that lead thither, rather then the ſorrow of Attrition: This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a direct occaſion of going to Heaven, and is an inferiour degree of more ingenuous ſorrow and true contrition: For this Legal (as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) Contrition is cauſed by the miniſtry of the Goſpel too, and is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Evangelical Faith, whereby a Chriſtian, having thorowly aſſented to, and been affected with the ſevere and holy Doctrine thereof, becomes humbled under it; and is brought to the ſight and admiration, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the other Part of it, which to the truly broken and penitent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth Grace and Pardon. That which ſeems to have miſlead ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a falſe notion of the Goſpel, is the term Goſpel or Evangel it ſelf, which ſounds nothing ſo much as mercy: though the Engliſh or Saxon word, we know, ſignifies originally no more than <hi>Gods Speech,</hi> which is indifferent<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> to Mercy and Juſtice both. And ſuch places as this of St. <hi>Paul, The Law worketh wrath:</hi> as if he had meant to ſay thereby, that the Goſpel did not work wrath as did the Law: but that was far from his purpoſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending only to ſhew the difference between the Law and the Goſpel (as they ſtood oppoſed) to be in this, That the Law without the Goſpel, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, wrought wrath without remedy, but the Goſpel though it propoundeth and threatneth wrath too, to the unbelieving and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55232:112"/>
diſobedient, yet continued in it alſo a ſufficient and proper remedy againſt all thoſe Evils. And thus far of the very intrinſick nature of Repentance, Attrition, and Contrition; which are the two proper Parts of it.</p>
                     <p>The two moſt noted acts or effects (for Parts they are not) are Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Satisfaction. And firſt we ſhall explain this Confeſſion by theſe degrees. Firſt, Out of the Abundance of the heart it muſt neceſſarily be that the mouth ſhould ſpeak, whether good or evil, truth or falſhood, joy or ſorrow. How then can it reaſonably be ſuppoſed that no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſion ſhould appear of ſo great anguiſh of mind, as is ſuppoſed to affect the ſoul truly humbled and penitent? No ſober man, much leſs good Chriſtian, can chooſe but commend ſuch Acts as this of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For, as the compariſon of an ancient Father hath it well; As it is with him that hath almoſt ſurfeited himſelf with ill digeſted or unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat lying heavy upon his ſtomach, muſt caſt it forth before he can well be eaſed or cured; even ſo he whoſe ſoul is oppreſſed with the filth, guilt, and weight of his ſins, muſt vomit them up by due Confeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can reaſonably expect remedy and forgiveneſs. Many and very preſſing are the adviſes and precepts of Holy Scripture to confeſs our ſins, and many promiſes to ſuch as do confeſs, annexed: which not intending at preſent, ſo much a Paraenetical or hortatory Diſcourſe, as Dogmatical for the ſettlement and information of the Judgment and Conſciences, I ſhall paſs over, as agreed to on all hands, in the general. But Confeſſion of ſins being ſo variouſly taken; <hi>viz.</hi> for confeſſion to God, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Man; for confeſſion private, and confeſſion publick; for confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our brother, whom we have offended particularly, and confeſſion to the Church, to which we have given ſcandal, none ever took the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on them to deny abſolutely the uſe of Confeſſion. Nay I cannot find any ſeriouſly and poſitively denying the lawfulneſs or uſefulneſs of private or auricular confeſſion to the Prieſt or Miniſter. Some indeed very ignorant, and no leſs ſuperſtitious perſons, are offended at the word <hi>Auricular,</hi> from the common uſe of it amongſt them whoſe Doctrine and Practice have corrupted it. But the ancient uſe thereof was quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than now adayes it is: as it is thus expreſſed by Biſhop <hi>Jewel.

                     <p>Many more ſuffrages for the uſefulneſs of Confeſſion, might be alledged of men of unqueſtioned authority in ſuch caſes as this: but now I ſhall come briefly to declare what is to be received, and what rejected in this Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: 1. In ſpeaking of the Original or Inſtitution. 2. The Neceſſity. 3. The Tradition concerning it. 4. The due Practiſe of it. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (however the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determined it of Divine inſtitution, to whoſe ſervile Canons we aſcribe not ſo much as to the leſs ſervile judgment of ſome of the Learned Doctors of that Church) being divided in its opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the inſtitution of it; the ancienter of them generally deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch Divine Precept; and they who come after the Council being obliged to hold up its Credit, affirming, we may without great danger or difficulty affirm, that Chriſt hath not in particular and preciſely required any ſuch Sacramental Confeſſion: but by general Rules of Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence inferring ſo much as a Council, and holy direction to aſſure our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which poſſibly may be obtained without, and more poſſibly be loſt for want of it. For the Prieſt under the Goſpel being the ſame to the uncleanneſs of the Soul, as was the Levitical Prieſt to the uncleanneſs and leproſie of the Body; it agreeth exactly with the Analogy between the Old and New Teſtament, that the like power be allowed to him in his Sphere, as was to the other, in his; and the like real, though not formal and expreſs command. Yea, I could ſhew (were it a place Scholaſtically to handle this matter here) how according to the opinion of the Learned ancient Jews, the people under the Law did practiſe this Confeſſion, and that upon opinion of a Precept in their Law. But I do not reſt upon any other than what the Goſpel affords, either in Letter, or Incluſively under thoſe duties which it preſcribes a Chriſtian. Yet what <hi>Solomon</hi> hath in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> I take not to be ſo much Legal as Evangelical. <hi>He that covereth his ſins, ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,</hi>

Sin is certainly the Leproſie of the ſoul: and 'tis becauſe men are led more by Senſe than Faith, or by a monſtrous Faith, rather than truly Evangelical, (which diſpatches compendiouſly, more than ſafely, all duties of Religion in a word or ſingle act) that they apprehend not the like danger or neceſſity in the caſe of their Souls, as Bodies; and therefore neglect the proper means conducing to their everlaſting health.

                     <p>And in the Goſpel, though I dare not, nor <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> affirm any particular direct Procept purpoſely delivered to enjoyn this; yet by conſequence and implication, it ſeems to be required, eſpecially in ſome caſes of apparent and grievous errors committed againſt the Faith and Holineſs of the Goſpel. For hither may the words of Chriſt well be drawn, whereby he commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his Apoſtles to act in his ſtead, himſelf leaving this world. <note n="*" place="margin">John 20. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Which words ſome Modern Interpreters reſtraining to the power of preaching the Goſpel (though I confeſs that to be true) muſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffer others to leave them, as they have their Predeceſſours, in that gloſs: For firſt the Goſpel might be preached by others as well as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: And next, whatever Remiſſion of ſins attends the publication of the Goſpel, is to be imputed, not ſimply and barely, either to the Preaching, or Hearing, or Believing the ſame; but, to the admitting by an effectual Faith all the things the Goſpel requireth to be done by us. And as by the preaching of the Goſpel in general and common, a general remiſſion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo publiſhed: So by a particular application of the ſame unto the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and private Caſe of ſome one Perſon, is confirmed in particular the ſtate of Grace or Impenitency to particular perſons, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prieſt. And to this alſo pertaineth what Chriſt ſaith in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to all bearing this Office: <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou bindeſt on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever thou looſeſt on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Implying indeed a Power communicative of perſons ſcandalous to the Faith and Church of Chriſt: But of the ſame power it is a branch, which is in every ſingle Prieſt proceeding judiciouſly in the Court of Conſcience to the binding, that is, declaring bound a ſinner; or looſening, declaring him, at leaſt, abſolved from his ſins, upon his repentance manifeſted to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:55232:113"/>Now the Reaſons obliging a man to this Confeſſion upon Scripture grounds are theſe. Firſt, That the Miniſter of God being according to his office not only to preach Chriſt and Repentance, and Faith, and remiſſion of ſins to all in general, but to apply and accommodate himſelf to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exigencies of men receiving, and diverſly affected with the Goſpel: which cannot poſſibly be but by a particular revelation made to him either from heaven, or the party to be judged. So that although it ſhould be a ſufficient diſcharge of the Prieſts part and office to make a general promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, and ſo declare that <hi>whoſoever believeth and repenteth ſhall be ſaved, but whoſoever believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> Yet the hearer or receiver doth not thereby fully diſcharge his part, unleſs he underſtands more ſatisfactorily than ordinarily men can of themſelves, their condition under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>For ſecondly, By this Confeſſion to another, a man comes better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and judge himſelf; as to his Faith and Manners. As no man can naturally, without the help of Art, ſee his own face, nor thoſe eyes, which ſee all things ſee themſelves, but by looking ſtedfaſtly in the eye of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may. So can no man ſo well at leaſt, no not by the glaſs of Gods word, diſcern thoſe things in himſelf which are to be ſeen by anothers eye: and therefore it muſt needs be a means to bring the preſumptuous to repentance, and the diſtruſtful to a comfortable ſerenity of mind and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Confeſſion is not only a ſign, or an act of Contrition, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means thereunto: For ſome there are who come to confeſs their ſins, and have no true ſenſe of them: others have a real ſenſe, which is commonly called Attrition, being well aſſured and convicted by their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they have done wickedly, and broke Gods ſacred Laws, but there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of ingenuous ſorrow, and an affection out of Charity or Love to God, this ſenſe will not avail to obtain pardon at Gods hands: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the wiſe Miniſtry of the Confeſſour, as he is called, he is to be wrought to a ſorrow of love, and ſuch as is conceived as well for the evil of ſin in it ſelf, as the evil of puniſhment it ſubjects him unto. Whence <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> in a certain place ſpeaketh thus, <hi>I would have you have a ſenſe of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chryſ. Tom. 1. pag. 139.</note> 
                        <hi>your errors by Confeſſion, and ſhew your ingenuity of your ſelves.</hi> For though it be a foul errror to hold, as many of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do, that the very coming to Confeſſion, or the cuſtomary ſentence of the Prieſt, turneth Attrition into Contrition; <hi>i. e.</hi> imperfect, and of it ſelf unprofitable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, into ſaving; yet the joynt exhortations, not to be ſeparated in ſuch caſes, do tend naturally to the more ſincere converſion of a ſinner unto God, upon the account of vertue it ſelf, and the love of Good and of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Such Confeſſion is a very notable aw and reſtraint upon the offender; it being too common with us here, to fear the eyes and ears of men more than of God: And infinite ſins we daily commit, which if we were thoroughly perſwaded ſhould come to the knowledge of Man, we would not dare to do, though we be aſſured in general that they muſt be known to God. And 'tis an extream folly and direct untruth which ſome have entertained, That we muſt do things only upon the moſt perfect principles, to the moſt perfect ends. For 'tis better a man ſhould abſtain from drunkenneſs to ſave his purſe, than not at all. And that a child ſhould learn for fear of the Rod, than gain no knowledge at all.</p>
                     <p>But this leads to a fifth benefit which is the more perfect; For infinite there are who, upon neceſſity and compulſion, have begun a good work, which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55232:114"/>
they have concluded with delight, and greateſt approbation, and with beſt circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Confeſſion of ſins to Man ſubſtituted ordinarily by God, is an excellent expedient to the preparing and enabling the Miniſter of God to relieve us upon our Death-bed. For how otherwiſe can he ſpeak with judgment to us in our greateſt Agony, when perhaps we cannot expreſs our ſelves? but if we have formerly opened unto him the ſtate of our Souls; he ſhall be much better enabled to aſſiſt in that our laſt conflict.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, According to the doctrine of them who hold it not only poſſible, but alſo a duty incumbent upon us, to get aſſurance of our Salvation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſins to the Spiritual Judge of ſouls muſt needs be very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: For ſetting aſide extraordinary Revelations, and granting the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge we have of the arbitrarineſs of God in the beſtowing free Grace, and continuing the ſame which we ſo often forfeit, and laſtly the natural affection every man hath to judge partially for himſelf, there doth not appear any ſo proper, outward, and ordinary means of coming to a true knowledge of his ſtate of Grace and Salvation, as the Miniſtration of a Prieſt unto us in Confeſſion; and his judgment of our ſtate of favour or<note place="margin">Qui confiteri vult ut inveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at gratiam, quaerat Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotem. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> disfavour with God: Neither can any man ſo ſafely acquieſce, to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his doubtful Conſcience, in the opinion he hath of himſelf, with out him, as with him. It is not to be denyed, that a man may by the grace of God and his own repentance, heal his wounded ſoul of an habitual ſin, and be really reconciled unto God, and find true and well-grounded peace of Conſcience, without the aſſiſtance of a Ghoſtly Phyſician, as he may cure himſelf by Gods bleſſing, of a Fever or Conſumption: Does this therefore make the uſe of a Phyſician ſuperfluous, and his Preſcriptions vain? No ſure. But it is not the like caſe of his ſoul, as his body: For ſenſe cannot there be ſo eaſily deceived, as his opinion of himſelf, as to his ſouls ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There is ſcarce any thing that is more common in ſpiritual matters, then that which is ſo rarely found in the condition of his body; <hi>viz.</hi> That a man ſhould be very ill, and not know, or very well, and not find it manifeſtly in himſelf. It is requiſite therefore, even for them who have truly repented before God, to be informed of their ſuch reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Gods favour; or their not being purged from dead works to ſerve the living God.</p>
                     <p>The great impediment is a natural modeſty, which peradventure the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may have an hand in: but this is occaſioned rather for the rareneſs of it; as may be ſeen from the undauntedneſs of ſuch as live in the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, where Confeſſion is ſo common.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, That the abuſes are ſo groſs, that the uſe ſeems inferiour to it, by the eaſie and familiar abſolutions given to notorious Offenders, and the great confidence theſe take to ſin upon expectation of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. But to this it may be firſt replyed, That unleſs abuſes be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from a thing in it ſelf good and profitable, they are not ſufficient to remove the uſe of it abſolutely. And ſecondly, in thoſe things that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and to be diſcerned by one meanly inſtructed in the principles of Religion and common Morality, if the Spiritual Judge delivereth a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſentence too favourable to the Penitent, he is able to judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf better, and ſo ought to do. For a Confeſſour cannot determine that to be no ſin, which the light of nature teaches to be, for he doth not judge of that, but of Religion. Nor can be determine againſt the firſt Principles of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> that without repentance any ſinner can be ſaved:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55232:114"/>
nor, that a man doth repent who hath no ſorrow for his ſins; or who ever at the time of a Formal abſolution, nouriſheth in his heart a reſolution to return to the ſame ſin he confeſſeth: So that in truth, a man is commonly falſe firſt to himſelf, before he is miſlead by others. And not Hiſtorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Scholaſtically to diſpute this, I ſhall only uſe that for an argument for it, which is often alleadged againſt Confeſſion, from the abuſe and ill event of it; for which <hi>Nectarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is ſaid to have put it down: For had the thing been ſo evil, or unneceſſary as ſome would have it, ſurely being once ſo judicially condemned and taken away, it could never ſo ſoon after have been reſtored, and continued all over thoſe countries to this very day: So that it may ſeem either out of too great zeal of that Patriarch to repreſs ſcandals, or to ſatisfie the incenſed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude at the ſcandal given, that ſuch a decree paſſed againſt it for a time: Though there is much to be ſaid, that the Confeſſion differed much from that here pleaded for; for that was by cuſtom publiſhed, but this under moſt ſacred ſilence: which if any ſhould reveal (being a condition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſo freely, that it ſhould be concealed) I make no doubt but the perfidious Prieſt committeth as great a ſin as likely he can hear from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and incurreth no leſs juſt cenſure of the Church, than is ordinarily inflicted upon perſons convicted of ſcandalous ſins. Saving, where (as<note place="margin">Conſtitut. and Canons, Can. 113.</note> our Church in her Canons hath ſoberly determined) the concealing of an offence againſt the Publick ſafety and peace, may bring a mans life in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And whatever elſe the ſin were, it alwayes turned more to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the diſcoverer, than the committer; and ſo may it do as well before God as Man.</p>
                     <p>The exception againſt it as <hi>Auricular</hi> is ridiculous and childiſh, not to be anſwered ſeriouſly. It is no Penance, but a Favour. The Church doth require a man ſhould open his Conſcience to his Prieſt, it doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it to be done in ſo great ſecrecy, but as a favour to the Penitent; who doth no leſs fulfill the mind of God, and the Church, if he proclaim his own ſins: provided it be with penitence, and not impudence. Some other corruptions crept into this uſeful practiſe come next to be noted and removed, in ſpeaking of the ſecnod Act or Effect of true Repentance, Satisfaction.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of Satisfaction an Act of Repentance: Several kinds of Satisfaction. How Satisfaction upon Repentance agrees with Chriſts Satisfaction for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s. How Satisfaction of injuries, neceſſary. Againſt Indulgences and Purgatory.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Law and Juſtice are then ſaid to be ſatisfied, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we walk ſo exactly and conformably unto them as to fulfill the primary intention of the Law-giver, in doing that which is juſt and equal: or the ſecondary intention of the Law-giver, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuffering due puniſhment and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the breach of it: And this is a ſatisfaction of the Law too, but not ſo perfect a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the former; as being intended no otherwiſe than to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the better the ſatisfying of it, in the Obſervation according to the firſt ſenſe. Neither doth this, though fully ſuffered, make any man juſt or innocent; but acquits him from farther puniſhment. The former is wont to be called <hi>Active Obedience.</hi> The latter, <hi>Paſſive,</hi> but very improperly: For there is no Obedience truly ſo called, but what is <hi>Active.</hi> For all Obedience is an act of the Will: but paſſiveneſs is no act at all. 'Tis true, a free and willing ſubmiſſion to the puniſhment inflicted by the Law, hath ſomewhat of action in is, and ſo of obedience; but the ſuffering it ſelf hath nothing of obedience, but is the effect of diſobedience. And therefore much more reaſonable is the diſtinction of ſatisfaction active, whereby we act according to the revealed will of the Legiſlator; and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> whereby we ſuſtain the penalty threatned againſt the diſobedient. And thus we in ſome ſenſe ſatisfie the Law, when we have undergone all that was impoſed upon us by it. This firſt part and moſt agreeable to the will of God, Chriſt, and no man elſe, abſolutely fulfilled, that we any where read of. Every Article, and every Particle of the Law of God was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by him. And this was yet no more than he ought to do as man. Now what ſupererogation can be, what redundancie to us, is hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, though confidently and zealouſly affirmed by many. This we can underſtand, this the Scriptures certifie us, that Chriſt being not obnoxious to the Law, and <hi>knowing no ſin, was made ſin for us; that we might be made</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> And from hence are derived all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and other benefits by Chriſt: For whereas they ſay, that Chriſts paſſive Obedience (as they call it) did ſet us free from puniſhment, but not purchaſe life and glory to us, there ſeems to be a miſ-apprehenſion of<note place="margin">Luke 10. 28.</note> the condition of glory and immortality promiſed by God. <hi>Do this</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and ye ſhall live: i. e.</hi> keep the Commandements. Again in the Book of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> God ſaith: <hi>The face of the Lord is againſt them</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 34. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>that do evil to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.</hi> And I know no middle ſtate in the Scripture, between life and death; or glory and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For God hath promiſed everlaſting happineſs, not to them that by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55232:115"/>
their Good works purchaſe or earn it, but to thoſe who live according to his Law; and ſtand innocent before him from the violation both of affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative and negative precepts therein contained. He that hath all theſe things remitted to him, is before God as if he had done all the duties of them exactly. He that is made partaker of Chriſts paſſive ſatisfaction doth thus ſtand acquitted, and by conſequence hath a title and claim by vertue of the ſame to everlaſting bliſs: without the conſideration of this active ſatisfaction or obedience.</p>
                     <p>Now to entertain ſuch an Opinion of a mans private and perſonal ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his ſins, as thereby to be able to claim any, either forgiveneſs of ſins paſſed, or happineſs to come, were to make the Croſs of Chriſt of none effect: Yet becauſe the Grace of God is not ſo free, that we ſhould need do nothing more to be made partakers of the fruits of it, than paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to receive it; but Chriſtian Religian, and Faith whereby we are juſtified and ſaved, is an active principle in us, leading to all Good works. Therefore it is required that we ſhould do ſomewhat to put our ſelvs into a capacity of the benefits of Chriſts Paſſion and Merits, whereby we are freely juſtified and ſaved: For as hath been ſaid, we are not ſo freely ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Grace, as to be abſolved from all conditions, but ſo freely, as that the conditions of coming to, and receiving Chriſt, by whom we are ſaved, have no proportion with the ſalvation from him, in juſtice or common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Now I ſee nothing againſt ſuch a ſatisfaction to be required of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true and faithful Chriſtian, whereby he ſatisfies the conditions of the Covenant of free Grace in Chriſt; and yet never ſatisfies the Law it ſelf, or for his ſins which is abſolutely effected by Chriſt: which agrees very well with what I find thus ſet down by one of our Church: <hi>We believe that</hi>

                        <hi>though Chriſt hath ſatisfied for the fault and puniſhment both eternal and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral for our ſins: yet our ſelves are bound to ſatisfie the commands of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel tying us to repentance and amendment, and patient bearing of the Croſs. Though we do not think that the doing of it, is that anſwers or expiates the judgment of God due to our ſins: but only ſerves as a Condition ſubordinately required, that we may be partakers of Chriſts ſatisfaction.</hi> Thus the Papiſts themſelves ſometimes deſcribe ſatisfaction out of <hi>Auguſtine, To be the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the cauſe of ſin, and the ſtopping of the wayes that ſuggeſt them:</hi> and ſtick not to grant there is <hi>but one ſatisfaction only to God, even that of Chriſt, and we do not properly ſatisfie, but only do ſomething in reſpect whereof Chriſts ſatisfaction is applyed to us.

                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:55232:116"/>But though theſe and the like, be not ſatisfactions of the juſtice, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mercy of God. Yet there is a ſatisfaction which is proper and in ſome ſenſe adaequate to the offence committed: and this is to our brethren whom we have wronged and ſcandalized: And is either publick, when we have done any thing againſt the Church in general, by unchriſtian practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as Murders, Sacriledge, Uncleanneſs, and ſuch like. It was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required that ſuch ſhould ſatisfie the will of the Church, of which they were members; and undergo penalties or penances judged meet for ſuch offences, and not be admitted into brotherly communion until they had ſuffered for their folly, to the content of the Church: A laudable neceſſary practiſe to be retained ſtill, as well that the offender being put to publick ſhame for publick ſins, might amend his life; and the Church may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the like contagion of ſin. For notorious offenders being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Communion, were not reſtored to it until ſuch ſatisfaction as this was made.</p>
                     <p>Another ſatisfaction, much of the ſame nature with this, is that which ought to be made to the utmoſt of our power, to them whom we have wronged by unjuſt words or deeds againſt them; which is neceſſary for the obtaining of Gods mercy and pardon to us. For if we muſt forgive the injuries done unto us, if we would have God forgive us our treſpaſſes, ought we not much more to give every man his due in point of juſtice? The firſt ſeems to be a Law purely Evangelical; but the ſecond Natural; ſuppoſed to the Goſpel, as imperfect, yet moſt neceſſary: The Rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt Divines is moſt certain, <hi>The ſin is not pardoned until the thing</hi>

                        <hi>taken away be reſtored.</hi> Now we take away a mans Good name, and we take away his Eſtate unjuſtly; and before we can ſay we have repented, we muſt be careful to our utmoſt to make this Satisfaction or Reſtitution. Where we take away a mans life, we cannot indeed ever ſatisfie the Party, no, though we ſhould dedicate our own lives to him: yet ſo far as we can even outwardly humble our ſelves, by afflicting our bodies and purſes; and eſpecially endeavouring by extraordinary acts of bounty and Charity, to preſerve the lives of ſuch who ſtand in need of our aſſiſtance and relief. It was no ſatisfaction to him whoſe eye was put out, or tooth broken, to have the eye, or tooth of his Adverſary to be ſtruck out for it. Yet it ſhewed in the Moral ſenſe thus much, that our utmoſt indeavour muſt not be wanting to make ſatisfaction to them we have wilfully ſpoiled, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, defrauded, or otherwiſe injured. For otherwiſe, it doth not appear how a man dying conſcious of ſuch apparent injuſtices as theſe, can eſcape the damnation of hell: A new ſtupifying notion of Faith freely juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may perhaps be ſo miniſtred to him, as to quiet his Conſcience, but ſave his Soul it cannot; where it is in a mans power to make recompence, and ſatisfie injuries and injuſtices.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe man is naturally ſo partial unto himſelf, as for his eaſe and ſelf-love, to make the beſt conſtruction of Gods mercy inconditionate to him, and his ſins againſt God: It was never in open notorious ſcandalous ſins, permitted to the offender to judge for himſelf, but his actions were ſubject to Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, and proper puniſhments impoſed upon him, to bring him, by thoſe outward cenſures to inward remorſe. Which ſevere cenſures, when they were obſerved to have a great effect upon the Penitent, were divers times remitted in part, lightened, and ſhortened by the favour of the Church, which were called therefore <hi>Indulgences:</hi> Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein the precept and example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the like caſe, of the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous

So that contrariwiſe, ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, leſt perhaps ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow, &amp;c.</hi> Leſt the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment impoſed on grievous offenders, meeting with a tender ſpirit, ſhould break the heart rather then humble it; and caſt him away, whom they intended to ſave thereby, a ſeaſonable relaxation was alwayes at hand to the reſtauration of ſuch an one. But as for that ſenſe and groſs abuſe of Indulgence, whereby it is turned to remit ſins aforehand, without due hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation paſſed; and not only ſo, but to reach the torments ſuppoſed to be inflicted on Chriſtians after this life in Purgatory, it is ſo abſurd in it ſelf, ſo unknown to all ancient Chriſtian ages, ſo inconſiſtent with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, and nature of Repentance, that as it is impudence in that Church to pretend any of theſe to favour it, ſo is it ſtupidity in any perſon to lend any credit to it, or have any relvance upon it.</p>
                     <p>It is uſually ſaid, That few ſouls going out of this life ſo pure and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly cleanſed, as to be fit preſently to enter into the holy place of heaven, where no unclean thing ſhall come; it is requiſite there ſhould remain ſome place to perfect the purgation of the Soul begun here. And that the power of the Church eſpecially the reputed Univerſal Father of it, extendeth in like manner to the mitigating and ſhortning of thoſe purgative torments, as to the penances inflicted upon Penitents on earth. Truly, if they could but prove, what they as yet have not taken the boldneſs ſo much as to ſay: that they, or the Church inflicted the torments of Purgatory upon ſinners there detained, I ſhould be apt to believe they could take off the Rod they laid on: but never pretending to that, I marvel they ſhould pretend to this, any more than they dare to the removal of a Fever by an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence only; becauſe they judged the Party ſo ill affected to have ſuffered, and been ſick long enough. There being not the leaſt ground in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enable them ſo far, nor any argument out of Scripture to perſwade themſelves of this power, ſo great as temporal gain, and filthy curſed lucre, more like to damn the pretenders to it, then ſave the tormented out of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                     <p>But this is upon ſuppoſal made of ſuch a Purgatory; but that it is only ſuppoſed and no real exiſtence, appears from moſt ancient Tradition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this day in the Church of <hi>Greece:</hi> which indeed taking occaſion from <hi>Origen</hi>'s ſingular opinion, doth affirm a Purgation, and that by fire, at the laſt day of the general Reſurrection, when by an unknown manner, God ſhall cauſe a purgation and change of the corruptible body of man into an incorruptible condition, more fit for heaven and glory. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometimes<note place="margin">Aug. Civ. Dei: lib. 21. c. 24.</note> doubted whether any ſuch place or ſtate after death were, wherein Souls were detained for their emendation and preparation for Heaven: He grants it poſſible, and that it is all: but actually and poſitively ſo to be, he no where affirms; but ſaith expreſly, <hi>I do not therefore affirm, becauſe I oppoſe it not:</hi> But the ſupream folly of cutting off ſcores, hundreds, and thouſands of years of torments, by Indulgences upon earth, was ſuch an impoſture as could never enter into the head of any of the ſober Ancients; and not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured amongſt Chriſtians.</p>

And whereas they ſay, That they who go to Purgatory may be ſaid to dye in Chriſt, becauſe they ſhall at length be delivered by Chriſt: How can that ſtand with ſuch exceſſive pains there ſuffered, to which none on earth are equal either in degree or continuance? How can theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls be ſaid to reſt from their labours and ſorrows? Muſt they not make God a mocker of his ſervants in comforting them againſt their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this world, by telling them they ſhall one day be delivered from them, and go to greater in Purgatory? Beſides, What grounds do they find in the Word of God, or the word of the primitiye Fathers, which makes a a twofold ſtate in Chriſt: One of them who by Saintly lives paſs immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to bliſs: Another of them who are in a middle ſtate, and are partly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and partly bleſſed? But to their prime argument the Anſwer is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. We are not generally purged wholly from ſin, nor have we made full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of puniſhments for our ſins in this Life, unleſs by Martyrdom, or ſome heroical and eminent Sanctity: Both are falſe which are here ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Firſt, That Martyrdom for Chriſt, or the moſt holy and exemplary life lead here in this world, do ſo perfectly purge us, that we need not further cleanſing. Again, it is denyed that true and ſincere repentance acted in this life, both in forſaking ſin, and in true converſion unto God, ſufficeth not to purge us from all our ſins in this life, as to the guilt and penalty of them, and the odious ſtain rendring the ſoul unaccepted to God, though men arive not to the perfection of Martyrdom, or the eminencie of Sanctity attainable here, as St. <hi>John</hi> witneſſeth: <hi>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light,</hi>

                     <p>Nor doth this take away what of prerogatives is juſtly due to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or eminent Holineſs in this Life; becauſe there remains proper to them, firſt a greater meaſure of comfortable aſſurance of Gods favour and bliſs hereafter; and a much greater and higher degree of glory when poſſeſſed, than inferiour degrees of holineſs here can lay claim to.

                        <p> Of Baptiſm. The Author, Form, Matter and Manner of Adminiſtration of it. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral neceſſity of it. The Efficacy in five things. Of Rebaptization that it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation but no evacuation of the former. Of the Character in Baptiſm.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MANY Acceptations are found of the word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture which I leave to others who have collected them: and betake my ſelf to the thing it ſelf commonly underſtood by it. And thus Baptiſm is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, inſtituted by Chriſt, conſiſting of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigns of Water and the Word, and the inward Grace of Regeneration and remiſſion of ſins, and outward Communion with the Church of Chriſt: all which I conceive to be contained in our Church Catechiſm, where it is firſt deſcribed by its outward Sign to be, <hi>Water wherein the Party is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And by its inward Grace to be, <hi>A death unto ſin and a new birth unto righteouſneſs; for being by nature born in ſin, we are hereby made the Children of Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Sacrament then of baptiſm is ſaid truly to ſucceed that of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: and to have the ſame Spiritual effect upon the Spiritual and inward man, which that had over the Outward. The agreement and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between which two will ſufficiently appear from the comparing of this, as we now ſhall explain it, with that, which we ſhall do by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Form, the Matter, The Subject, The Efficacy, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The Form we have propounded to us by Chriſt, when he firſt inſtituted the ſame, and commanded his Diſciples to go and <hi>teach all nations, baptizing</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to obſerve all things whatever I have commanded you.</hi> From whence it doth appear that taking Baptiſm ſimply, for the Act, it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in that form of words here preſcribed by Chriſt; and the outward Action of baptizing with Water. But taken more Concretely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly for all things concurring to that Sacrament eſſentially, It is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made between God and Man, whereby is promiſed on Gods part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins and ſalvation, and on mans part, Faith and Obſervation of the terms of the Goſpel: as St. <hi>Mark</hi> more expreſly hath it, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 16. Eph. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> This Covenant was typified by the Sacrament of Circumciſion made between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> with his ſeed; thus, <hi>This is my Covenant</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>which ye ſhall keep between me and you and thy ſeed after thee: Every Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child among you ſhall be circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> And this was yet more cleerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of, by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaying, <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 35</note> 
                        <hi>ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you.</hi>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:55232:118"/>
And as with men, that is no ſure Covenant which doth not conſiſt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter mutually paſſed from one Party to another: and of due form of words thereunto required; So neither is that proper Baptiſm which makes no expreſs or implicite ſtipulation between God and man, and that with that form of words and Action by Chriſt enjoyned.</p>
                     <p>And the Matter of this Sacrament is expreſſed already to be water, by many places of Scripture: as <hi>Mat. 3. 6, 11. Joh. 1. 26. Joh. 3. 23. Act. 8. 36, &amp;c.</hi> And having none other mentioned by Chriſt, we are not ſo much to argue preſumptuouſly of inſufficiency of that Element to effect ſo great matters, upon the ſoul, and thence conclude; That it is unlikely God ſhould be ſo rigorous to exact indiſpenſably a little water, or cauſe the party to periſh in his ſins: for 1. This way of reaſoning holds no leſs againſt Gods ſevere impoſition of Circumciſion which was the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of a ſmall pitifull piece of Fleſh: and yet that omitted, God threatneth poſitively to cut off the ſoul of the child from his people.<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 14.</note> 2. This takes away the Liberty and power of God to diſpoſe of his Graces upon what terms he pleaſes: for the manner of conveying whereof, he may chooſe what means he pleaſes, though never ſo improbable to ſenſe, to attain ſuch ends; that it may appear the vertue is not in the thing ſo much as God. 3. God in ſuch Caſes doth not ſo much tye himſelf, as tie us. He doth indeed oblige himſelf to thoſe means himſelf hath ordained: but not confine ſo himſelf to them that he cannot or may not work the ſame effect without them: Yet as he ſo reſtrains that, he threatens wrath, and makes no promiſe at all, but upon our dutiful obſervation of ſuch his Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But as when a man, not by any wilful neglect, or diſeſteem of the uſefulneſs of this Sacrament, ſhall, by invincible neceſſity, be detained from it, with a fervent deſire to be partakers of it, God by his abundant Grace may ſupply the want of it. In like manner, where there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per natural water to be had, rather then the ſolemnity ſhould wholly be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and denied to one earneſtly craving the ſame, Uſe may be made of that which comes neareſt to it, ſo of a nature cleanſing. But this needs farther determination to put out of doubt, than any private Doctour can give. For we read in Scripture of no other element (though in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Hiſtory we do) than water. And there appears no greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">Pallad. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. Hiſtoriâ.</note> or ill conſequence for men to be brought to that extremity for want of natural water, than to want the general means of Chriſtianity itſelf: or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to die unbaptized.</p>
                     <p>But the manner of applying this water to the party baptized by Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or dipping into the water, or by Aſperſion or Sprinkling, and that thrice, or once only, is not much to be inſiſted upon. For though 'tis unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that it was a general Ablution by ſinking the Baptized into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth when he ſpeaketh of <hi>being buried with Chriſt in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4. Col. 2. 12. Math. 3. 16. Act. 8. 38.</note> 
                        <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that as Chriſt was laid under the earth, after his death, ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians under the water, and were buried unto ſin: And other phraſes of Scripture which ſpeak of aſcending out of the waters, and deſcending into the waters. Yet that any waſhing by aſperſion or ſprinkling ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, appears from the Analogy between the Sacramental Purgations of the Old Law and the New: For as infinite places certifie us, the blood of the Sacrifices, and waters of Purification were to be ſprinkled on the Perſons therein concerned: And ſo the end of the Sacrament of Baptiſm is to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, and conferr Grace on the baptized by ſuch outward Elements: to<note place="margin">Exod. 29. 2. Levit. 14. 7.</note> which, the vertue of the Sacrament, not conſiſting in the nature of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55232:118"/>
thing, but in the Inſtitution of God, greater quantity can conduce no more then leſs, provided ſo ſmall quantity be not taken, which ſhould hide and hinder the ſignificancy of the Elements. And beſides, Gods rule being, <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and never intending to ſave the Soul by ſuch means as in common probability may deſtroy the Body, the condition of ſome perſons being ſo frail and weak: and of ſome Climates ſo hard and hurtful, he is pleaſed to accept the moſt ſafe way, the ſubſtance of the duty being entirely obſerved. And ſuch perſons are not only Infants, but the Sick and very Aged too, who were baptized with water: and that upon a neceſſity of entring into the Kingdome. For could ſcarce any thing betray <hi>Calvine</hi> with his Followers ſuch as <hi>Perkins</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> more to ſuſpicion of inſolence and ſingularity than his ſeeking to elude the plain precept of Chriſt concerning Elemental, not Spiritual water<note place="margin">Job. 3. 5. 6.</note> and waſhing only, contrary to the univerſal conſent of all Catholicks, and Hereticks before him: as if he had taken the riſe of his Fancy from theſe two famous Anabaptiſts <hi>Balthazar</hi> and <hi>Satelare</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> who<note place="margin">Caſſand.

Now from theſe general Rules laid down by Chriſt in his word, a juſt and particular inference may be made to the entitling Children to a Right in this Sacrament: it being a Rule which holds no leſs in Divine, than Humane Laws, That where the Law doth not diſtinguiſh there men ought not to diſtinguiſh, or limit. For if it be alleadged that Inſtruction and Faith ought to go before this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to Chriſts Intention and inſtitution in St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> It is ſufficiently anſwer'd; that, ſeeing the Law General by which baptiſm is made neceſſary to Salvation, hath no exception or condition annexed to it, which may concern Infants, Infants are therein contained. And this implies an exemption from that naturally impoſſible preparation of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Faith properly ſo called: And as <hi>Calvin</hi> well notes, Believing<note place="margin">Calvin Inſtitut.</note> to infant-Baptiſm is no more requiſite than working to their eating and drinking, by vertue of the Apoſtles precept, <hi>If any will not work, neither</hi>

But where a Perſonal power of Willing is found, there is exacted a perſonal knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that Sacrament. This will appear from thoſe ſeveral reaſons built upon the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Primeſt antiquity ever ſo underſtood the Scripture and practiſed accordingly. Not that Baptiſm was preſently as now adminiſtred
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55232:119"/>
to Children at their coming into the world: ſeeing Antiquity gives us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances of ſuch who were not baptized till they came to years of diſcretion, though they were born of Chriſtian Parents: For ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Catecheumenes</hi> together with them who were young, and Converted from Heatheniſm unto Chriſtianity. Others, of purpoſe and deſign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the time of their baptiſm, upon an opinion that all their Actual as well as Original ſins were waſhed away in Baptiſm; and concluded they had the leſs to anſwer for, if they were baptized towards the latter end of their dayes. Yet though this abuſe of Baptiſm prevailed not upon that opinion only, but upon the occaſion which was taken of educating and inſtructing Infidels in the Faith, for ſome good time before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, which cuſtome divers born of Chriſtian Parents imitated; yet we find none that the Church wilfully ſuffered to die without Baptiſm, who were deſcended of true believers, or had been competently inſtructed in the Faith of Chriſt: which was alwayes, according to Chriſts words, intended towards them who had None to reſign them up to God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe for their due perſeverance in the Faith. So that there is not the leaſt evidence of Autority ancient in the Church rejecting the baptiſm of children or denying them to be ſubjects capable of it. And none oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame until the year 1030 when <hi>Guimund</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Averſa</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi> accuſed <hi>Berengarius</hi> Deacon of <hi>Anjou,</hi> for denying Infant-baptiſm; though that opinion was not found directly to be <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s. But about the year 1130 this Hereſie began to diſcover it ſelf in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> and was Headed by <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> and <hi>Henricus</hi> his Scholar. From whom that Faction was called <hi>Petrobruſians</hi> and <hi>Henricians;</hi> denying withal a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Childrens entring into the Kingdom of Heaven; affirming, That only they who were baptized and believed could enter into Heaven. But the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who ſucceeded them in many of their opinions, rejected this their Dogme; and ſo the controverſy ceaſed, until the year 1522. when one <hi>Nicolas Stork</hi> and <hi>Thomas Muncer</hi> (two deſperately Phanatical men) ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Sleiden Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> up this opinion, and other wicked fancies concerning Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: wherein this Latter periſhed miſerably. Yet this error was not ſo ſoon or eaſily ſuppreſſed, but ſpread farther and continued by the great induſtry and zeal of <hi>Melchior Rinck</hi> and <hi>Balthazar Hebmaier;</hi> until about the year 1532 it received its complement from the tongue and hand of <hi>Melchior Hofman,</hi> a Leather-dreſſer of Germany; and ſo hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to other places, and to this day. But not only did none of the ancients oppoſe Pedobaptiſm, but have declared and proved the uſe of it: As did <hi>Irenaus, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Auguſtine,</hi> and others downward, were this a proper place to ſhew ſo much. We ſhall rather proceed to thoſe Scriptural reaſons inferring this.<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, either all Children muſt be damned dying unbaptized, or they muſt have baptiſm: The conſequent is plain from that Principle in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, which Anabaptiſts have been conſtreined to deny, to uphold their other, <hi>That all ſin not waſhed away or expiated, expoſes to damnation:</hi> and the Principle in Chriſtian Religion, is, That Children come into the world infected with Original<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now there is no remedy but Chriſt; and his death, and Paſſion are not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto any but by outward Signs and Sacraments: And no other do we read of but this of Water in Baptiſm. And the invitation of Chriſt of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55232:119"/>
infants, in St. <hi>Mathew</hi> doth imply a capacity in them of Grace. For<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 13. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>not, for of ſuch is the Kingdome of God:</hi> he doth not mock, meaning lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that Infants who are not able to go, or ſtand, ſhould come unto him, on their own leggs: So neither doth he mean in the ſpiritual ſenſe, that Children who have neither reaſon nor Faith, ſhould come unto him by Faith, before they be baptized; but be brought to him by the Faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which may profit them who reſiſt not, though they ſeek not that Grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They that are of the Covenant, and of the Body of the Church really, ought alſo to be formal partakers of that Body; and this they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can obtain by being admitted ſolemnly into the congregation of Chriſts Faithful and Elect Church: As the children of the Iſraelites were of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be admitted into the number of that Church, by circumciſion,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 14.</note> or be cut off in wrath, from them. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, how the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Believers, are ſanctified by their Parents. And how are they<note place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>7. 14.</note> holy but by being ſeparated from unbelievers, and ſolemnly dedicated to God by the Laver of Regeneration? And as in the ſame place the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Romans, If the firſt fruit be holy, the Lump is holy: and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches;</hi> drawing this Literal to an Evangelical ſenſe; and meaning thereby, that the Parent being of the Election, the Child is ſo: and being ſo, ought to receive the ſign of Evangelical cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Analogy and apt correſpondence between the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law called Circumciſion, and that of the Goſpel, warranteth this. For that is not true which they ſay againſt this, That the Precepts of the New Teſtament neceſſary to Salvation, are as clear as thoſe under the Old: But this is not ſo clear as Circumciſion: To which we anſwer, That this is as true, taking in the whole manifeſtation of Gods will: For the clearneſs of the Sacraments enjoyned in the Old Teſtament do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the clearneſs of them <hi>ſignified</hi> by them. And there needs nothing more be ſaid for the clearing of the neceſſity of theſe, than to admit them to have ſucceeded thoſe two in the Old Teſtament: And we find not ſuch neceſſity particularly impoſed upon us of receiving the Euchariſt, as was upon the Iſraelites of receiving the Paſchal Lamb, but general neceſſity, without determination of time or place, the Goſpel expreſſeth unto us, upon the hope of ſalvation; which is ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>The vertue and Efficacie of this Sacrament above-touched proves this farther: but it needs it ſelf be proved according to thoſe extravagant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions brought by Modern Divines into the Church, that it is only a ſeal of our Faith, and eternal Favour of God in Predeſtinating us to Glory. As if, Firſt, all (according to their judgements) that were baptized were ordained to Glory, and this were aſſured them by that Seal. Or Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God had Predeſtinated any to Life without the neceſſary means to it: Or that remiſſion of ſins Actual, and the expiation of Original, were not neceſſary to the entring into Life, or that God had ſo ſimply and abſolutely ordained us to heaven, that he had not ordained theſe two as Means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55232:120"/>
our Parents believe, and not made ſo in Baptiſm.</hi> Which is contrary to the Doctrine of our Catechiſm and the whole ſtream of Primitive Doctors of the Church, from whom we may Gather this threefold Effect of Baptiſm. Firſt, it is not only a ſign as the ſame Perſons ſay, of our Covenant, but it is the Covenant it ſelf made between God and Man. For God indeed doth make a Promiſe, but he maketh no Covenant otherwiſe than by Baptiſm. God made a Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> that his ſeed ſhould be bleſſed before Circumciſion, but he made no Covenant with him, but by Circumciſion; nor is any actually in the Covenant of Faith, but by being baptized. Doth not the Scripture expreſly ſay, that <hi>God gave Abraham the Covenant of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 7. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> Circumciſion then, was not only a Sign of that Covenant, (though that it were) but an Eſſential part of it. Circumciſion therefore was a ſign in a twofold ſenſe; Firſt, in reſpect of the Covenant under the Law; as words whereof the Covenant conſiſts, are ſigns of the Will of the Covenanters, to the ear: and works outward are in like manner ſigns of the ſame to the Eye: which ſort of ſigns are not diſtinct from the thing it ſignifies. For God Covenanted with <hi>Abraham</hi> that he ſhould uſe thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Now this outward viſible Covenant was a ſign of an inward and inviſible, relating to the righteouſneſs of Faith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Abraham: And he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom 4. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>of Faith.</hi> So that is the Second way in which Circumciſion may be ſaid to be a ſign, <hi>viz.</hi> As the whole Sacramental Covenant of which it was a part, ſignified the Covenant of Faith: into which we are entred by Baptiſm, as the Jews into the other by Circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>A Second effect of Baptiſm is, to waſh away all ſins, as well Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as Actual: of which that Propheſie of <hi>Zacharie</hi> is generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountain opened to the houſe of David, and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Zechar. 13. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem; For ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi> To which St. <hi>Paul</hi> agrees, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſpeaking of the Church: <hi>That</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>he might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water, by the word.</hi> Where the Word ſanctifieth the Water, and the water ſanctifieth the Perſon: which it can no otherwiſe do then by waſhing off the ſins of the Soul. As St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>of a good Conſcience towards God:</hi> That is, at the time of baptiſm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the filth of the Spirit neceſſarily implied to make up the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is put away. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Corinthians; They were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>they were Sanctified, viz.</hi> By Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>But whether Original ſin be ſo far extinguiſhed in the baptized, as no more remains ſhould be found, is much doubted: to which we briefly and clearly anſwer from the diſtinction of Sins. For ſometimes the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of ſin is termed ſin: Sometime the Effect of Sin is called Sin: whereas Sin is properly the Evil Act it ſelf, or the omiſſion of an act due from us. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin in us is not ſo properly called Sin, as it was in <hi>Adam</hi> who actually ſinned, and that with a conſent of his own will. But it is rather the Effect of his Actual tranſgreſſion which doth originally adhere to us, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſin upon this threefold account. Firſt, becauſe it is the neceſſary effect or conſequence of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin: as we find <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak in <hi>Deuteronomy. And I took your ſin the Calfe which ye made:</hi> The Calfe was the fruit of their Sin, and<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 21.</note> not their ſin it ſelf. So is that evil Effect, the Sin Original, becauſe it is the evil conſequence of it. Secondly, It is Sin, becauſe it doth partake of the nature of ſin in one of the principal parts making up ſin. They are two, The Obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Act, or Deformity and diſagreement to the accurate Law of God,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55232:120"/>
and the diſobedience of the will, and pravity thereof: This latter, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin as it was actual in <hi>Adam,</hi> had as well as the former; but ſo is it not with us. There can be no ſuch diſobedience in the Will, where there is no Will. There is no will in Infants beſides the remote faculty it ſelf; and therefore, all ſin, yea all humane acts requiring conſent of the Will, original ſin cannot be ſin in this ſenſe: But taking ſin for a diſſonancy from<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 4.</note> the Law and Rule, as St. <hi>John</hi> doth; and that conformity as is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law; certainly that Original depravation and corruption found generally in our natures at our firſt entrance into the World, may truly be called ſin, becauſe it makes us to differ ſo much from that God made us, and intended us to be. Thirdly, Original ſin hath this likewiſe denominating it ſin, that it is the cauſe of ſin; that original inclination to ſin being that which moves us all unto the actual commiſſion of ſin; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſurely aimeth at, where he ſaith, <hi>Now then it is no more I that do</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>it, but ſin that dwelleth in me:</hi> meaning by that, <hi>ſin dwelling in him,</hi> the pronity natural which impelled him to ſin, with ſuch particular diſſent and reluctancy of judgment, that he could ſcarce be accounted the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal author of it. To theſe we may add a fourth general event of this original pravity, <hi>Viz.</hi> An hatred and indignation conceived in God againſt the perſon ſo depraved, contrary to his inſtitution and mind. Now Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms efficacy may have relation to all thoſe, but not in like manner. For it waſhes away the filthineſs of the ſoul, original and actual. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It reconciles to God, and obtains remiſſion of ſin. Thirdly, It doth not remove or wholly redreſs the depravation of the ſoul, and the evil tendencies and diſpoſition of it to ſin; which is the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and cauſe of our own actual tranſgreſſions. This is not deſtroyed by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but lurks in the ſoul; and like fewel is apt to take fire upon the leaſt ſpark of temptations, which ſhall be caſt into it from outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and occaſions. And though it be ſo far done away that until ſuch new riſings and agitations of the mind, it be not imputed; yet upon ſuch kindlings it putteth on a new guilt.</p>
                     <p>Another effect it hath in reference to actual ſins. For firſt, by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning though not deſtroying abſolutely the principle of ſin in us, a ſtop and curb is put to ſin in its future progreſſions: And not only ſo, but proper means of which by and by are provided in Baptiſm for the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and putting away all actual ſins too. For repentance being, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of the Ancients, a <hi>ſecond Plank</hi> to ſave ſuch as are ſhipwrackt, after Baptiſm, either in their holy Faith, or holy Life, doth effect this no otherwiſe than by vertue of that principle of life remaining in the ſoul, infuſed at firſt by Baptiſm. For, as Baptiſm hath no power to procure mercy at the hands of God towards them that ſin after they are ſo waſhed and ſprinkled, without repentance: So neither hath repentance ſufficient vertue to reſtore us to innocency, and Gods favour, unleſs Baptiſm goes before; becauſe all remiſſion of ſins depends upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made in Baptiſm; which on our part is either to abſolute holineſs without ſinning after Baptiſm, or to true Repentance for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>A third Effect of Baptiſm is our Regeneration and new birth, or being born again by this Water and the Holy Ghoſt. For as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 3. Tit. 3. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration and renuing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A fourth Effect is an incorporating into the body of Chriſt, as well vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as inviſible, which together with the former is declared in the form
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55232:121"/>
of baptiſm contained in our Liturgy, where it is ſaid, <hi>Seeing now, dearly Beloved, that this Child is regenerate and grafted into the body of Chriſts Church, let us give thanks, &amp;c.</hi> Which the Apoſtle intimates when he ſaith, <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And upon both theſe followeth a Fifth Effect, which is, an intitling the Baptized unto an inheritance in heaven. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If Children,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>then heirs: heirs of God, and joint heirs of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As we in baptiſm are all baptized into one body of Chriſt, ſo are we into one Spirit. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body—ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And again, <hi>There is one body, and one Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13. Eph. 4. 4. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>even as ye are called in one body of your calling: One Lord, One Faith, One Babtiſm.</hi> For the Baptiſm of our Saviour Chriſt being the Patern of ours; what in a more glorious, and viſible manner followed upon his Baptiſm, in an inferiour manner attendeth our Baptiſm. It is ſaid by St. <hi>Mark, And ſtraitway coming up out of the water, he ſaw the Heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove deſcending upon him:</hi> Which Spirit doth likewiſe upon the moving of thoſe waters of New Life, deſcend and inſpire the perſon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. In which ſenſe is St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be underſtood when he ſaith, <hi>If any</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his:</hi> That is, if he be not partaker of the Spirit given in common to all Chriſtians, at the time of their Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>From the foreſaid neceſſity of Baptiſm, is inferred the opinion of the Miniſter of Baptiſm, making it a work in it ſelf common to all Chriſtians. For all things moſt neceſſary, as in Nature, ſo in Grace, are moſt eaſie and common. As therefore Water is the moſt neceſſary thing in the world, next to air, (without which no man can live ſo long as without water) to mans natural ſubſtance, (and therefore is made by God moſt common to all perſons, and cheapeſt of all things to mans Life,) ſo doth it agree well with Gods divine Goodneſs in Religion, to make that moſt common, and freeſt to be attain'd, which he hath made ſo neceſſary to Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing that is neceſſary to our Salvation is the breath of Gods mouth (as the Scripture teaches us to ſpeak) the word of God: which<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 6.</note> ſanctifies both the perſon, and the Element of Baptiſm, Water; which is the Second. Therefore I make no great queſtion but as it was free at the very firſt Publication of the Goſpel, and ſo at this day is ſtill, in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in ſome manner, for thoſe called <hi>Lay-men,</hi> to declare the word of God and inſtruct Unbelievers in the truth of the Goſpel, (which afterward, it was reſtrained to the Sacerdotal Office;) So upon the foundation of Faith before laid, by preaching, in all capable perſons; and incapable, by others in whoſe power they are, that it is lawful for them who are no Prieſts to baptize. And the anſwer to this doth rather explain and confirm than deny it. For the Oppoſers of Lay-mens baptizing, ſay, That Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is twofold, Private, and Miniſterial: and that a man may in Private, as Maſter of a Family, inſtruct others, but not Miniſterially. The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf is ill ſet together; for ſurely both are Miniſterial Acts, and more eſpecially, that which is denied to be ſo; Private Baptiſm: as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leſs of Viſible power ſo to do; or authority: and therefore of an inferiour Miniſtration. But this is juſt the Caſe of Baptiſm. For we ſay not that Lay-men may baptize as Publick and Legal Miniſters out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but as Private miniſters, and in extraordinary Caſes. We bring the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55232:121"/>
example of <hi>Zipporah</hi> circumciſing <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſon, juſtifying the like power<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 28.</note> of Baptizing under the Goſpel: And they reply nothing hereunto, but what makes more againſt themſelves. For if ſhe did it (as they ſay,) in the preſence of her husband, when there was no need, ſhe did it in haſte, that ſhe might prevent her husband; ſhe did it in anger. And yet this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion held good and was accepted: How much more might it have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, if done by her more ſoberly, and ſeriouſly, as it ought by all whether Miniſter or otherwiſe? And that this Act of <hi>Zipporah</hi> was not ſo exorbitant in the manner of doing as vulgarly ſuppoſed, more learned Men have ſhewed at large.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, That is was not ſo extraordinary, doth appear from the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, as <hi>P. Fagius</hi> hath obſerved upon <hi>Deuteronomy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fagius in Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron. <hi>C. 10. 16.</hi>
                        </note> Cap 10. v. 16. <hi>do believe, if a Man be wanting, to whom it belongs; one Uncircumciſed, as a Servant, a Woman (ſo not an Heathen or Infidel,) a Youth may circumciſe an Infant.</hi> Neither was Circumciſion to be repeated made by what man ſoever, though an <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Infidel.</hi> And in brief, We find no perſon excluded by the Catholick Church from doing this office, for one deſiring it or capable otherwiſe of it, but a Mans ſelf. And yet we are told by ſearchers into the ancient practice of the Jews, that a man might circumciſe himſelf. And thus much of the Firſt Proper and Generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Sacrament to Salvation, Baptiſm; adding only one thing more for a concluſion, and that is, about the Repetition of Baptiſm, or Anabaptiſm. Of which prophanation of that ſolemn Sacrament, I find many really guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but not ſo much, nor upon thoſe grounds they are Generally charged. For, I have not met with any that directly affirm it to be requiſite or lawful to reiterate Baptiſm, though in fact they do ſo. For the <hi>Novatians,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and they of Late years, who are called from the Renewing of their Baptiſm, <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> have none of them (that we find) declared it reaſonable that Baptiſm once truly performed ſhould be acted over again: but all theſe ſuppoſe it not done, and therefore they do it. It was always the opinion of the Catholick, as well as Heretical, and Schiſmatical Churches, That all outward words or waſhings ſufficed not to the due effect of baptiſm. There were three ſeveral incapacities which render'd pretended baptiſm void, ſo far, that the Perſon ſo baptized was held obliged to be again baptized. The incapacity of the Miniſter or Baptizer: The incapacity of the Perſon or ſubject to be baptized: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the incapacity of the Form uſed in Baptiſm. If the Miniſter had any time fallen from, or denied the Chriſtian Faith, or was of impure and Scandalous manners, he was reputed by the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a ſacred Office; and conſequently in that (though a Prieſt) did not effectually adminiſter that Holy Sacrament, imagining that he who was ſo defiled himſelf could not by his <hi>Miniſtration</hi> cleanſe another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was baptized not as repeating former baptiſm, but as not being baptized at all. The <hi>Arrians</hi> being enemies to the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, and judging the Catholicks to be ſo too, in aſcribing too much unto Chriſts divine nature, looked on the form of baptizing as corrupt and inſufficient to ſuch an end; and therefore thought another, neceſſary. And our modern Anabaptiſts as they are called, not thinking Infants capable of that Sacrament, for want of Faith and Repentance, (which they hold ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and that in the propereſt ſenſe) deny any effect to follow upon thoſe Actions uſed. So that we ſee there are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Anabaptiſts; ſuch I mean, who hold it ſo much as needful to baptize
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55232:122"/>
any perſons above once. Though in Fact they ſtand guilty of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation, upon the grounds of others not hard to be made Good againſt them, as we have againſt theſe laſt, ſhewing the Capacity children are in of receiving Baptiſm, as alſo that the unworthineſs of the Perſon miniſtring Sacraments doth not impede the effect of thoſe Sacraments, while he hath a proper ſubject to work upon; and obſerves the proper form requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Now this form, according as the <hi>Arrians</hi> excepted againſt at, doth depend upon the diſputation of the Divine Nature of Chriſt, proper to another place.</p>
                     <p>It may here be doubted, whether the zeal of ſome of the Ancients, but of moſt of the Schoolmen hath not too far tranſported them, who damn all ſuch as repeat Baptiſm once rightly adminiſter'd; it being impoſſible in their opinion, that Baptiſm ſhould be twice acted, but the Former muſt be renounced: and truly, if Baptiſm once truly performed be renounced, that which follows is alſo renounced being in it ſelf good: For there is but <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. But this can never be proved, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> and perpetually true. They indeed, of whom now we have ſpoken; who were ſo engaged in heretical opinions and ſocieties as to believe the imperfection and inſufficiency of that Baptiſm they received, could not admit of another, but they muſt reject the firſt. But then, whether abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely they rejected true Catholick Baptiſm, may be a doubt: For he only renounces his Baptiſm properly, who rejecteth the Form it ſelf, and the Faith therein implied. And this is the <hi>One</hi> Baptiſm of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is certainly to be underſtood: that is, neceſſarily <hi>One</hi> in nature, but that it ſhould be alſo ſo <hi>One</hi> in number, as multiplied both ſhould be made void, no reaſon is given. And ſurely St. <hi>Paul</hi> intended no ſuch thing: though he may be ſaid much leſs to have intended the multiplication of it. The more probable opinion therefore of the two is, That the Second Baptiſm is void rather than the firſt: As if two married perſons being joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Lawful Matrimony once, ſhould preſume a Second time to go, through the ſame Ceremony, it may be, only to confirm them in that ſtate; this were to baffle and prophane ſuch Ordinances, but it were not to make the former Vows and Rites void.</p>
                     <p>And for the reaſons given againſt Iteration of Baptiſm, though I yield the Concluſion, that it ought not ſo to be, I do not hold them convincing, uſed to this purpoſe: Not that taken from the indelibleneſs of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſuppoſed to be imprinted in the ſoul, by that Sacrament. 'Tis true, Circumciſion had a viſible character made in the body, which could ſcarce be altered or removed: But that therefore, to anſwer this, there muſt be a proportionable impreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>on the ſoul, which is inviſible, follows not. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Circumciſion a ſign, and a ſeal; and it is Baptiſm in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical ſenſe: And the Fathers, who many times mention ſuch things, intended nothing more than an immutable Obligation on our part to God, and an infallible communication of Gods grace to them who duly are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Sacraments. It is alſo true, a Man can be born but once ſpiritually, as naturally; and therefore ſuperſluous and prophane are all attempts to a Regeneration a ſecond time; the principles of ſpiritual life being preſerved intire in themſelves, though in a way to be extinguiſhed upon pertinacy in ſin, and dying in impenitency. And for thoſe places of Scipture where St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, we are <hi>ſealed by Gods ſpirit,</hi> alledged,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 21, 22. Eph. 1. 13, 14. Eph. 4. 30.</note> to prove that we have a Character made in Baptiſm upon us; it is evident, that they are to be underſtood not of the ordinary Baptiſm, by Water,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55232:122"/>
but the extraordinary, of the Holy Ghoſt, ſometimes preventing Baptiſm; as appears in the <hi>Acts</hi> more than once: Other reaſons out of Scripture<note place="margin">Act. 10. 41.</note> brought to this purpoſe do prove only that to repeat Baptiſm is needleſs, but not damnable. For the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who are reported to Baptize<note place="margin">Breerwoods Enquirit.</note> themſelves once a year, on the ſame day that Chriſt was Baptized, do it as the Hiſtory of them tells, not ſo much implying an invalidity in one Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, as a convenience to bring to mind the Baptiſm of Chriſt, on <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany;</hi> perhaps reckoning the precept of Chriſt given to Communicate in Remembrance of him, might hold to the obliging them to repeat Baptiſm in remembrance of his Baptiſm.</p>

denomination of <hi>the Lords.</hi> And that not only in Scriptures, but amongſt Primitive writers too. And, <hi>Altar</hi> of the Lord it was called, only Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, not properly, by both: no otherwiſe than the Lords day was called by way of Analogy, <hi>The Sabbath day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Form uſed at the celebration of thoſe Myſteries, it was called <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which was <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> as <hi>Mathew</hi> 26. 26, 27. From the Effect, which was double, <hi>Communion</hi> with Chriſt, and with the Members of Chriſts Body, the Faithful, it was termed <hi>Communion, 1 Cor:</hi> 10. 16. From the Matter of which it conſiſted, The Body, and Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Corin: ibid.</hi> And many more leſs conſiderable appellations have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church, to be paſſed over in this ſhort view: wherein we are rather to enquire into the Nature of it in theſe Particulars, <hi>viz:</hi> 1. The Author. 2. The Matter. 3. The Form. 4. The Ends and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                     <p>For the Author, It is, without controverſy, Chriſt himſelf; the hiſtories of the Goſpels plainly ſo affirming, <hi>Mat. 26. 26. Mar. 14. 22. Luc.</hi> 22. 19. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians. 1 Epiſt.</hi> 11. 23. It ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing herein peculiar to it: it being neceſſary to all Sacraments, ſo properly called, that they be Inſtituted of God, or Chriſt: as is above proved.</p>
                     <p>The Greateſt contention of all, is concerning the Subject-matter of this Bleſſed Sacrament, not in a few words to be opened, or compoſed. The cleareſt way to proceed in this diſquiſition is, Firſt, to conſider the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Part, and then the Internal. The External are the Signs or Elements appointed by Chriſt, to inſinuate and repreſent unto us his Paſſion; or as his own expreſs words are, to bring to remembrance his death and Paſſion. <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> And what is here only recorded by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19.</note> to have been ſaid of the Bread; St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth to have been likewiſe ſpoken of the Cup, <hi>Do this as often as ye drink it in remembrance</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11-25.</note> 
                        <hi>of me:</hi> declaring unto us the uſe, and end of the Inſtitution of theſe Signs. But before we go any further, it will be neceſſary in our way to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the twofold moſt principal and common acceptation of the word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> here: For ſometimes it is taken Complexly, for the whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Lords Supper: and at other times, only for the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Part of it: which again is ſometimes taken for the External or ſignifying Part, the Elements; and ſometimes for the Internal, or things by them ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, which are the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and that not ſimply and abſolutely, but as under the conſideration of his Bitter death and Paſſion, and that for our ſakes.</p>
                     <p>The Elemental and External parts of this Sacrament are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ways: Firſt, before the celebration, or conſecration of the ſame; and then after. Firſt then it is generally agreed to, on all ſides, that our Saviour Chriſt took natural Bread, and natural Wine, moſt commonly in uſe in thoſe Countreys; and therefore in all reaſon, this ought to be a conſtant, binding preſcription to all that miniſter, and uſe that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and not to vary from the very kind uſed by him when ever it can with any tolerable care and coſt be obtained. But ſeeing that Chriſt in all probability, without any ſcrupulous choice of Wheat or Rye, or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley or any one ſingle Grain, made uſe of that which was in ordinary uſe at Meals amongſt them, and there being no expreſs word, which of theſe he took, there appears no reaſon why any one, of which Bread may be made, for the ſervice and life of Man, may not be taken to this purpoſe: And
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55232:123"/>
eſpecially, conſidering that the end of the Inſtitution, which is ſaid to be the repreſenting of Chriſts death and Paſſion, and the affecting us thereby, may no leſs be performed by the one ſort than the other. Yet where the conſtant practice of the Church, confirmed by poſitive Injunctions, hath determined the kind, it can be no ways free or ſafe for any unneceſſarily to vary from that. It is of much greater difficulty to determine, What is to be done in the caſes of ſuch, both extreme Northern, as well as Southern<note place="margin">

And conſidering withal, that Bread may be eaſily taken, not for that only which is made of our common Corn, but for that alſo which ſupplies the<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> uſe, and fulfils the natural ends of Bread, and bears ſufficient proportion to the agreements between the Natural and Spiritual Bread, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſtated it, <hi>We being many, are one bread: for we are all partakers of that</hi>

In the latter Analogy of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We are all</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ejuſmodi eſſe debet Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiae, ut multa in unum redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur. Aug. <hi>Tract. 26.</hi> in Joann.</note> 
                        <hi>partakers of that one Bread,</hi> that is, as we all in the Communion partake of one Loaf outwardly, ſo we inwardly all partake of that one Bread of God, that came down from heaven, Chriſt Jeſus; no leſs in ſome other one body, than in proper bread; I ſay, (not abſolutely determining that ſo actually it is, but) that the Repreſentation makes no ſuch difference, but ſo it may be.</p>
                     <p>And this, methinks, they ſhould be moſt inclinable to, who religiouſly obſerve the mixing of water in the other Element, Wine: which otherwiſe muſt needs infinitely and inextricably perplex the minds of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Communicant both. For it being not at all determined in nature, what the Schools in general determine, <hi>viz:</hi> that ſo much water may be mixed with wine, till it ceaſeth to be truly wine, and yet the Element ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of effectual conſecration; I ſay, it being not determinable in nature by the acuteſt judgement, preciſely, what quantity of water deſtroyeth a quantity of wine; it may ſo fall out, that by the undue mixture of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the wine ceaſes to be wine: and then, what becomes of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they ſay eſſentially, and indiſpenſably requires wine? It is very hard and preſumptious to affirm that none but natural (no artificial water drawn from diſtillations) have any efficacy in baptiſm, eſpecially if they have a cleanſing nature with them; as all, or moſt in ſome degree have: ſeeing they may ſignify the ſame for which Natural water was ordained. For otherwiſe, we may ſay, that Hot water, being in ſome ſenſe artificial, was not in any caſe to be uſed to ſuch ends. And diſtilled waters are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not abſolutely made, for then there might be more reaſon to exclude it, but is that Elemental water of which the natural Body doth conſiſt; though not diſtilling naturally but praeternaturally from the body, out of which it is forced; and retaining more mixture than the common ſort doth. And
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55232:124"/>
ſo may we affirm much more of Bread, that the commonly known Bread is that which ſhould be preferred without all doubt, yea not without greateſt ſcruple ſhould be neglected; but when that which is in place, and common uſe amongſt ſome Nations, ſeems to them more natural, and ours more unnatural and artificial, doth there not appear great reaſon to admit that? Or can we imagine that Chriſt whom we find the leaſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions or ſcrupulous of all men of his age, in things not directly limited by a Law, but of themſelves indifferent, would not have followed the cuſtoms and opinions of men in ſuch Regions, had he converſed with them? Is it not a reaſon rendred by the Ancients, and that a very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient too, againſt the Perpetuity and Univerſality of the Jews wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;<note place="margin">Euſebius De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst.

And will not it, or at leaſt may it not be alledged as ſtrongly againſt the proper Catholickneſs of Chriſtian Religion, that the Laws thereof, and that one of the moſt ſolemnand neceſſary, cannot be obſerved by all Nations? It will be ſaid, That ſuch things as are ſo neceſſarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, may be imported from other places. Very true. And ſurely where it may, it ought. But to make any Countrey, which Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence extendeth it ſelf to, of it ſelf uncapable of receiving as good Chriſtians, as any place in the World; or to make the Religion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to depend on Merchandizing neceſſarily, is more than in modeſty can be ſaid, or by reaſon maintained.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the condemnation of the Hereſie of the <hi>Aquarii</hi> of old, or ſuch as ſolemnized this Sacrament with water alone, condemn abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the uſe of all other Liquors beſides Wine in it; becauſe they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the uſe of all beſides Water in that Sacrament, contrary to Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Chriſt, without doubt, celebrated with proper wholeſome Wine, of the fruit of the Vine: And this argues ſufficiently that the like is to be uſed, and none other, where it is attainable. And the argument of the Schoolmen which ſay, That neither Sider nor Perry, nor liquor preſſed out of Raiſins, nor Vinegar, nor ſuch like are apt matter for conſecration, becauſe they are not proper Wine, may be allowed, taking apt for proper and convenient; but ſcarce if taken for Poſſible; as if they were not <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptible</hi> of Sacramental conſecration, where they are in common uſe. And though Vinegar ſeems to draw neereſt to the nature of Wine, and in that reſpect more apt than other Liquors, yet in this it is more unapt, becauſe it is the drink of no people. And yet <hi>Alexander Alenſis</hi> granteth that in ſome Regions they conſecrate altogether of Vinegar, becauſe to them Wine in its pure nature cannot be brought. This they underſtand rather of Wine degenerated of it ſelf, into ſuch an <hi>acidity</hi> or ſowrneſs, than of that which is ſtudiouſly made ſo. But if nothing which art hath counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited and adulterated can be received as the matter of this Sacrament, how many Sacraments in Chriſtendom would be abſolutely void, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants deluded of their expectations? And ſeeing in the corruptions of Wine by other ingredients, as well as Water, the Caſuiſts determine that it ceaſes then only to be capable of this ſacred uſe when it retains its nature, not otherwiſe; but cannot determine poſſibly when the nature firſt begins to change to a deſtruction: What infinite and grievous ſuſpitions and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples muſt evermore afflict the minds of Communicants upon conceit that the matter they ſo receive may have ſuffered ſuch ſtrange kind and degrees
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55232:124"/>
of compoſition that the nature of Wine is really loſt, and an artificial liquor not much to the eye or vulgar taſte diſcernible, taken in its ſtead; to the nulling of the effects of the Sacrament, and much worſe, where ſuch a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical Converſion of the Elements into Chriſts Body and Blood is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and received with anſwerable Faith and worſhip. The diſtinction of Material and Formal Idolatry (of which we may hereafter ſpeak) little redreſſing that monſtrous evil.</p>
                     <p>And if we are not ſo indiſpenſably and abſolutely tied to the natures of things in this Action, much leſs ought there to be ſuch warm and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentions about the condition, form, or qualities of thoſe Elements which in no manner change the nature of them: as Leavening, or Unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; or forming the bread after the common uſe, or in ſuch manner as may be thought leaſt ſubject to prophanation in making the Bread into ſeveral Cakes or Wafers, which though it nulleth not the Sacrament, yet it corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Inſtitution and End both, in ſome meaſure. For Firſt, it is certain Chriſt celebrated on ſolid, uſual bread; and why ſhould we upon private imaginations, next to vain Superſtition, introduce another order than Chriſt pitched on, and amend by fine contrivances what he but rudely laid down, as we irreverently muſt ſuppoſe? Again, It doth ſeem more than an indifferent Ceremonie, which, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and after him the Fathers, ſignified the Unity of Chriſt, and his Members, and of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one with another by that one Sacramental Body viſibly repreſenting, and exhibiting inviſibly Chriſt in that One Bread. And laſtly, That Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of breaking Bread, ſo much practiſed by Primitive Chriſtians even in this Sacrament, and thereby expreſſing Chriſts own proper Body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for our ſins, a very Fruitful, Reaſonable, and ſignificant Action, is altogether laid aſide; to the great injury of Chriſts inſtitution and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans edification. Surely, if any thing, this is to make our ſelves wiſer than Chriſt, and to be ſubtiller and more zealous for his Majeſty than he would have us: which cannot be wiped off by that common refuge and reſerve at pinching objections, <hi>viz:</hi> The Power of the Church. For the Church has no Right (what ever Power it may have) to make alterations at pleaſure, upon no better grounds than were at the firſt known and neglected, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental things; though the nature of the Sacrament may remain inviolate. For ſeeing the Sacramental Signs were ordained by Chriſt to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the particulars as well as general of Chriſts Paſſion, and the manner, as well as the thing it ſelf; to the intent that the more deep and lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion might be made thereof in our Souls, to pare off, (out of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches Power, and more reverent miniſtration and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation thereof,) the Ceremonies ſo immediately and ſignificantly expreſſing the End of it, and uſed by Chriſt himſelf, and for ought doth appear, for ſeveral Ages after, is to invade the Rights, and call in queſtion the Wiſdom of Chriſt himſelf. And ſurely then, The Breaking of Bread ſignifying the violence offered to Chriſts Body, and the Powring out the Wine intimating the ſhedding of his Blood for us, nothing can be more uſeful; and therefore to abrogate theſe, and invent and impoſe others upon pretences not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but rejected at the firſt Inſtitution, argues more ſuperſtitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption than ſober Devotion.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the things ſignified in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the Body and Blood of Chriſt. How they are preſent in the Euchariſt. Sacrament ally Preſent, a vain invention. All Preſence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corporal or Spiritual. Of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Signs' and things ſignified. The Real Preſence of the Signs neceſſarily inferr the Preſence of the Subſtance of Bread and Wine. Signs and thing ſignified always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT thus far of the Signs: The things internal and ſignified are yet of greater importance to our Faith and worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body and Blood of Chriſt: The ſeveral Diſputes about which we ſhall reduce to theſe two General Heads briefly to be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Firſt, the manner of Exiſtence of them in the Euchariſt: And next the manner of Participation: which two do mutually illuſtrate one another. For as to the Real Preſence it ſelf, I find no ſuch real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which may deſerve diſcuſſion. For ſurely, If Chriſt or his Body and Blood be at all Preſent in this Sacrament, they are really preſent; For imaginary fictitious preſence is no better than a Mockery unworthy of any Philoſopher to admit, and much more Divine. Whatſoever is, Really is, or not all; according to this account: And therefore to ſay, We All agree in the thing, though we differ in the Manner of Chriſts Preſence, is to ſay no more, and to draw no neerer at all to the compoſing of this difference, than we may have any common Philoſopher to joyn with us, upon this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Chriſt is Preſent there, for that muſt needs be really. So that no Chriſtian can deny the Real Preſence abſolutely, but muſt preſently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret himſelf in ſome peculiar ſenſe to himſelf. And they that do ſo, are wont to begin with a diſtinction of <hi>Sacramental,</hi> and <hi>Corporal,</hi> or as ſome, <hi>Natural</hi> Preſence. For Sacramental Preſence, (it being not at all heard of or known in Logick, or Nature, nor to be explained by any thing paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to it, out of this Myſtery it ſelf,) who can be the better for it? Who can underſtand what is meant by it, before he be reſolved of the thing moſt of all queſtion'd, <hi>viz:</hi> What is Sacramental Preſence? For unleſs we be cut off here, and muſt not at all enquire, What it is to be Sacramentally Preſent, but take the notion at a venture, and preſume we know what in truth we do not, we ſhall be as hard put to it as before. For Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be preſent doth not at all expreſs the manner, unleſs, as ſome ſeem to mean by it ſuch a Myſtical preſence that we know not what to make of,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55232:125"/>
(and in this acceptation every unknown thing ſhould create a new kind of being) but imply all ſenſes poſſible to a Sacrament. So that if a man holds Chriſts body to be in the Sacrament Bodily and naturally, this is certainly a Sacramentally, and, If he holds it to be there Spiritually, it is likewiſe Sacramentally, and ſo whatever other way we can reaſonably conceive to be in the Sacrament it muſt be Sacramentally: Sacramental Preſence being (as is ſaid) no one kind of Preſence, but common to all poſſible to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, if not to nature it ſelf,</p>
                     <p>It will be more needful to diſtinguiſh between Chriſts <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> and Chriſt <hi>Corporally Preſent;</hi> and there is good ground for to do ſo. For if <hi>Preſence</hi> be as <hi>Thomas</hi> defines it, 1. <hi>Qu. 8. Ar. 1. 2. The communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one thing with another; ſo many waies as a Body imparts it ſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo many may it be ſaid to be Preſent to it.</hi> And theſe ways are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to be two. Firſt by immediate contact and conjunction. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by a Virtual or Effectual communication with it, the Subſtance it ſelf continuing remote. So that though Chriſts body ſhould be determined to one certain place in Heaven; yet may it by its vertue communicate it ſelf to us in the Sacrament, and be ſaid to be Preſent really, though not Corporally, after the manner of bodies in their natural ſtate, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity.</p>
                     <p>And what we now ſay of the Subject of this Sacrament will hold no leſs in the Caſe of Participation of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt. For as Chriſts Body may be ſaid to be really though not Corporally Preſent and immediately: So may it be ſaid to be received Really, and not Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtically only, though not Corporally after the manner that other bodies are received. For they that affirm that Chriſts body is Corporally, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, received, do ſay, if not what they know not themſelves, yet what no body but themſelves can apprehend: For either theſe terms are really diſtinct, or Not. If they be not, then are they either ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or at moſt explicatory one of another: but this latter cannot be ſaid, becauſe <hi>Sacramentally</hi> is more obſcure than <hi>Corporally;</hi> and <hi>Corporally</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a much groſſer degree of Preſence than the Framers of this diſtinction will admit to agree with theſe Divine Myſteries. If they be diſtinct, whence ſhall we fetch the nature of this Sacramental Preſence? whenas there is nothing to be found in Nature to reſemble or explain it; but it muſt be deſcribed by it ſelf: And <hi>Sacramentally Preſent</hi> is no more than to be preſent in the Sacrament: But what it is to be preſent in the Sacrament, or how a thing may be ſaid to be preſent in the Sacrament otherwiſe than in other Caſes, we ſhall ever be to ſeek, and conſequently never learn. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt be conſtrained at length to reduce this large and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Preſence Sacramental</hi> to one of the two old ſorts of the <hi>Preſence of Influence</hi> only, or <hi>Preſence of Subſtance</hi> it ſelf [or <hi>Suppoſitum.</hi>] So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Influence only of Chriſts Body and Blood ſhould be found in the Euchariſt, and the vertue of them be therein communicated unto us: or the very natural Subſtance alſo.</p>
                     <p>We have hitherto ſpoken of the Preſence it ſelf preciſely taken from its Cauſes and manner external: For according to Philoſophers there is a <hi>Modus Eſſentialis,</hi> and a <hi>Modus Accidentalis.</hi> The Eſſential manner is ſimply to be, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the intrinſique natureof a thing: as the intrinſique nature and manner of a Body is to be Corporally and of a Spirit to be Spiritually: that is, As a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as a Spirit. But as a Body ordinarily and naturally palpable and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may remain a true real Body and yet not be ſeen, or felt; ſo may a Spirit
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55232:126"/>
remain a Spirit in ſubſtance, and yet appear as a Body. So that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Chriſts Body may be preſent corporally in the eſſentials and formal nature of a Body, and yet not appear in the accidental or ſeparable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of a Body; which are actually to be ſeen and felt at a competent diſtance. Theſe I call accidental, becauſe they may be wanting, as well by reaſon of the defect of the ſenſes which ſhould perceive them, as of the ſenſibleneſ, of ſuch objects: For a Divine power may take away the one, as well as the other, by impeding the ſenſe: though ſeeing the very nature and eſſence of a Body conſiſteth in being extended, and quantitative, it cannot be conceived how a Divine Power can divide them which mutually conſtitute one another; though it may render them imperceptible to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe. And ſo Chriſts Body may be in the Euchariſt, ſo far corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as to have all real and eſſential modifications of a Body: but not ſo Corporally as to appear in the proper forms of a Body. But granting, or ſuppoſing rather, that Chriſts Body were in this Latter ſenſe preſent in the Sacrament, there appears no great reaſon, why this ſhould be called a Sacramental Preſence more than that preſence when he was with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at Supper; and as the Scripture ſaith, Vaniſhed out of their ſight:<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 31.</note> that is as the word and ſenſe import, not tranſlating his Body ſuddainly to another place but diſappearing in that place, or ceaſing to be ſeen by them: anſwerable to the contrary power ſhewn in his ſudden appearing without any previous Act, and <hi>ſtanding in the midſt of them,</hi> before they<note place="margin">V. 36.</note> could be aware of it, or ſuppoſe any ſuch thing: which was occaſion of their great Affrightment and amazement, ſuppoſing him to be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.<note place="margin">37.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is one thing to be <hi>Poſſibly</hi> and another <hi>Actually</hi> ſo to be. And yet farther, Actually for Chriſts Body and Blood ſo to be preſent; and to be ſo Preſent as there ſhould remain nothing ſubſtantial or material be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them; and the Signs to be changed into the things ſignified by them, abſolutely and totally, the ſhew or Accident only excepted. So that the Queſtion is double, Firſt, Whether thoſe Subſtances of Bread and Wine remain after conſecration really the ſame they were before, or be totally aboliſhed? Secondly, It is inquired, not ſo much whether Chriſts Body and Blood be really preſent in the Sacrament, but whether it be really the Sacrament it ſelf, as it muſt neceſſarily be, if ſo be that they be in ſuch manner really preſent, as there remains no other ſubſtance beſides them.</p>
                     <p>For the former of theſe, the knowledge of the Real Preſence of Signs, Bread and Wine, do exceedingly conduce to the underſtanding of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preſence of the Body and Blood of Chriſt under, or through thoſe Signs. And it ſhould ſeem that the Roman Advocates of the New ſenſe of a Real Preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood, proceed not in the proper and natural method, rightly to found their Doctrine. For, as according to them, there muſt be in order of nature, though not of time, a <hi>Deſition</hi> or abolition of the Elemental ſubſtances, before there can ſucceed thoſe Divine ſubſtances; ſo ſhould they have firſt by ſound and ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proved the deſtruction of the preceeding <hi>Bodies,</hi> and then have inferred the ſucceeding. But on the contrary, They firſt preſume on the Second (upon what grounds we ſhall hereafter ſee) <hi>viz:</hi> That Chriſts Body is ſo really ſubſiſting there; and then conclude, that the Elements are not there ſubſiſtent. For he that holds that the Sacramental Signs do not exclude the Body and Blood of Chriſt, doth likewiſe hold that the Body and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55232:126"/>
Blood of Chriſt are not inconſiſtent with the Real Preſence of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It muſt not be denied that thoſe texts of Scripture which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alleadged to Parallel Chriſts words, and conſequently to give a more favourable ſenſe than that of Tranſubſtantiation; do not exactly fit the Caſe. For when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is a Door, or Chriſt is a Vine,</hi> or <hi>a Lamb,</hi> it is not the ſame formally, as to ſay, that a Lamb is Chriſt, or a Door, or a Vine is Chriſt. Yet if that rigour muſt be obſerved in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Propoſitions to have them true, that without a Trope or Figure, they muſt be underſtood, otherwiſe, we muſt be reproached to deny Scripture; the foreſaid ſpeeches muſt as neceſſarily inferr a Tranſubſtantiation of Chriſt into the Nature of a Door, or Vine, or Lamb; as his bare words at the Celebration, do inferr a Tranſubſtantiation of the Elements into his Nature. And no apparence of diſparity can be here ſhown; if ſo be Chriſts Literal meaning muſt be here urged as they do.</p>
                     <p>Now, That the Signs which were before, are Really Preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after Conſecration, doth appear from the moſt-Eſſential thing to a Sacrament. A Sacrament we have defined to be a Viſible Sign, with <hi>Auſtin</hi> and infinite others: I ſay, a Viſible and Real Sign, and not <hi>Viſibly, Apparently</hi> or <hi>Seemingly</hi> a Sign: or a Sign of a Sign, as the deluding <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieſes</hi> remaining after ſuppoſed Tranſubſtantiation, are ſaid to be. And it is an Impoſſible thing, as is before ſhewed in the general treating of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that the Sign ſhould be the thing ſignified. For if ſome Sign could be the thing ſignified; then, ſomething ſignified ſhould be a Sign: and ſo both wayes the Relate and Cor-relate ſhould be the ſame too; and two ſhould be one, and one ſhould be two: and if this may be, what may not be? or at leaſt, ſaid to be? For as to the inſtances given, That in ſome Caſes a thing may be a Sign, and the thing ſignified, it hath been ſhowed how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective they are, in that they are a Sign of the ſame nature perhaps, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome qualification of it, and not of the ſame thing numerically, as the individual Sign in the Lords Supper is believed to be of that it is. Therefore from hence they are put to their choice, Whether of the two they will ſuffer: the loſs of the Sacrament, or the abſence of Chriſts Body in their ſenſe. For not only the nature of the thing now expreſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Sacramental Signs as well as the thing ſignified, but the manifold Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torities of the Ancienteſt of the Greek and Latin Fathers have for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, called the Sacramental Elements, <hi>Signs, Figures, Repreſentations, Types, Antitypes</hi> of Chriſts Body and Blood: as might at large be ſhewed, our Adverſaries not denying it. But what anſwer do they make to them? The Modern Greeks as Cardinal <hi>Beſſario</hi> (who is herein followed by ſome more modern than himſelf) Latinizing; anſwer, confeſſing that the Fathers<note place="margin">Beſſario Do Euchariſt. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento.</note> often ſo ſpeak, but (ſay they) they ſpeak only of the Bread and Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſecration, and not after. Here is ſome wit in this ſhuffle and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but no truth at all. For before Dedication and Conſecration, they are not Signs, or Figures, or Antitypes at all: They have no more relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Body and Blood of Chriſt, than the like Elements at our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tables: and therefore they muſt be underſtood to ſpeak of them after Conſecration. But the Anſwer of the Scholaſtical managers of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in the Latin Church, ſhows leſs modeſty and no more truth. For<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.</hi> in Pſal. 3.</note> they ſay, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who calls the conſecrated Elements, a <hi>Figure of Chriſts Body: ſpake not of every empty Figure, but of a Figure of a thing really preſent.</hi> All this we grant willingly, <hi>viz:</hi> that the Signs Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal are not Signs of things future, or Abſent: This is nothing at all to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55232:127"/>
purpoſe. And the Second anſwer is notoriouſly and boldly falſe, ſaying, That St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> might there ſpeak as <hi>Manichee,</hi> who denied the Real Body<note place="margin">Contra Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. <hi>C. 12.</hi>
                        </note> of Chriſt: For it was in confutation of <hi>Manicheans.</hi> And of <hi>Tertullians</hi> words, who likewiſe calls the conſecrate Elements, Signs, they make non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; joyning head and tail together, that they may really ſignifie nothing, leaſt they ſhould ſignify that for which we alleadg them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaies, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum: Id eſt, Figura Corporis mei. Figura Corporis mei,</hi> ſaies one (after his greater Doctors) <hi>is referred not unto Corpus meum,</hi> as an<note place="margin">Fiſher Jeſ.</note> explication thereof, but unto <hi>Hoc</hi> in this manner: <hi>Hoc; id eſt, Figura Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris mei, eſt Corpus meum.</hi> i. e. <hi>This; that is, the Figure of my Body, is my Body.</hi> If it be not ſufficient conviction of their Errour, and confuſion, that they are driven to ſuch unnatural toſſing of mens words againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and Grammar, and having ſo done, to affect nothing but what is directly falſe or unintelligible, (as this Scholie is making the Figure and the Body the very ſame thing,) I confeſs I have nothing to ſay.</p>
                     <p>For this is the ſubject we have at preſent in hand, That the Sign and thing ſignified muſt by eternal neceſſity, be diſtinct: but this opinion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation deſtroys this: and deſtroying this, deſtroys the Sacrament. For whereas they ſay, That the remaining <hi>Species</hi> ſupply the place of the Subſtance aboliſhed, and are Signs: This cannot conſiſt with the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſuch Accidents without a ſubject; in that, contrary to their definition, they ſhould ſtick, and not ſtick to a thing; in that they are Accidents, their nature requires that they ſhould have a ſubject; and the nature of this mutation requires they ſhould have none. And where as they argue, That what any Creature can do, the Creatour can much more do; and therefore, if the Creature can ſuſtain Accidents, the Creatour God Almighty can. I anſwer, If the Creature could ſuſtain Accidents without a ſubject, then doubtleſs could God the Creatour; but doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that becauſe the Creature can be a ſubject to them, therefore the Creatour can alſo? All that a Creature can <hi>Do,</hi> the Creatour can do: but all that the Creature can <hi>Suffer,</hi> I trow the Creatour cannot: But to be the ſubject to Accidents, is a Paſſion, and imperfection, and no Action: and therefore nothing can be concluded from hence. Therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one ſtrain higher, not doubting to ſay, That, what the Creature can do by its Paſſive Capacity, the Creatour can do by his Active, which if it did not imply a contradiction in nature itſelf, I ſhould eaſily grant: but this it doth. For firſt, it is to make an Accident, a Subſtance: For tis the nature of a Subſtance, to ſubſiſt of it ſelf without the aid or ſupport of any other thing, diſtinct from it. Not that the Secondary being can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without the Firſt, God himſelf, but without any thing Created. And therefore ſeeing that Subſtance it ſelf cannot continue in its Being without Gods omnipotent hand ſupporting it; this doth equalize the nature of Accidents to that of Subſtance, in that it ſuppoſeth that Accidents, by a divine power, may ſubſiſt of themſelves, as well as Subſtance. For ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance cannot ſubſiſt at all without a Divine power: and thus Accidents by a Divine power ſhould be of the nature of Subſtance: but ſuch confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and havock in nature, to bring in an unnatural Dogm, is no ways to be admitted, not out of any defect in the Divine Power, but an incapacity of the Creature to be ſo order'd, againſt its nature.</p>
                     <p>And as this Condition of <hi>Species</hi> ſubſiſting or exiſting ſeparately of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is contrary to their nature: So the ſignificativeneſs of theſe <hi>Species</hi> is contrary to Chriſts Intention, and Inſtitution; which were to make a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55232:127"/>
repreſentation of his death and paſſion, by Bread and Wine, and not by the <hi>Similitudes</hi> of Bread and Wine. And this is to be noted, That when the Ancient Fathers both Greek and Latin do affirm that Chriſts Body or Blood are preſent under the <hi>Species</hi> and Forms of Bread and Wine, they do not mean ſuch <hi>Species</hi> as the Schools of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have introduced, (for I find not that they took any notice of them,) diſtinct from the ſubject to which they relate: but they took them in a more plain ſenſe, for the thing it ſelf ſo affected and formed: and <hi>Under the Species,</hi> ſignified with them as much as <hi>Under the Kinds</hi> of Bread and Wine, Chriſts Body was preſent. And they never deſtroyed the Sacrament it ſelf, to give an extraordinary Being to the Body of Chriſt therein.</p>

For the doubt will not be ſo much about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance, and co-exiſtence of it with the Sacramental Signs; as, Whether that which we See with our eys, and touch, and taſte, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and not denominatively and Figuratively only, the Body of Chriſt. And in effect, Whether it be the very Sacrament it ſelf, or whether only in the Sacrament. The Doctrine of the Church of Rome determines not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>There it is;</hi> but directly and expreſly, <hi>This it is:</hi> and this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as that which indeed muſt include ſuch a Tranſubſtantiation as is by them affirmed, and the chiefeſt grounds whereof we are now to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt from Scripture, they are wont to argue, and that from the Old<note place="margin">Bellarm: <hi>Lib. 1. Cap. 3.</hi> De Sacram. Euchariſt.</note> Teſtament: where are recorded many Types and Figures of Chriſt, and particularly, his Paſſion: which were no leſs, if not much more clear than the repreſentations in the Euchariſt; if Chriſt himſelf be not there otherwiſe than Figuratively. For the Paſchal Lamb ſlain, ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſts Paſſion more Lively and expreſly than the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Therefore, if that the Sacraments of the Goſpel might exceed them of the Law, it is neceſſary that what was done there Figuratively only, ſhould be properly and really performed in our Sacraments. <hi>Anſw.</hi> But firſt, ſuppoſing Tranſubſtantiation, is Chriſt more clearly in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than if there were no ſuch thing? Or can the Sacrament of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel be ſaid to be more clear for this, when in truth it is more Myſtical and abſtrufe? But though it be not more clear to the ſenſe or Reaſon, yet it is in it ſelf more really preſent: For otherwiſe the Legal Sacrament muſt have been only a Figure of this Figure of Chriſts Body, and not of the<note place="margin">Bertramus.</note> Body it ſelf. But the anſwer of <hi>Bertram</hi> to this about eight hundred years
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55232:128"/>
ago, is ſufficient to this purpoſe; that both the Paſchal Lamb, and the Sacramental Elements both Figured and repreſented Chriſts body: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chriſts Body future, and its Paſſion; and the other Inſtant, (as at the Inſtitution) or Part, and compleated. So that in truth, a great prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence there is in the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, above them of the Old: which is the thing contended for. But Chriſt was really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in both.</p>
                     <p>The next Argument taken from Chriſts words in the ſixth of <hi>John:</hi> where he ſaith amongſt many other things, <hi>I am the Bread of Life.</hi> And again, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 48. 53. 54.</note> 
                        <hi>Verily, Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you. For my Fleſh is meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed:</hi> Is anſwer'd two ways. Firſt, from a conſent on both ſides by ſome of the Learnedeſt, That Chriſt ſpake not of a Sacramental Eating and Drinking of him; but Ordinary, in receiving him by Faith, preached: But becauſe, as many on both ſides affirm that he pointed at the Euchariſt, in theſe words, therefore I think it moſt reaſonable, and equal to take in both ſenſes: and that Chriſt intended the receiving of him by Faith in the word preached, and in the Euchariſt too. And though Chriſts Fleſh be meat indeed, and his Blood drink indeed, it doth not follow at all, that it is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> ſo: For things Metaphorically ſuch, are really, though not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. And Chriſt doth not ſay, <hi>Caro mea eſt verus cibus,</hi> or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis meus verus eſt potus.</hi> i. e. My Fleſh is true meat, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: My Blood is true Drink: but My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed: that is, verily and really. And beſides the difference before intimated between theſe expreſſions and that at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt when he calls the Bread his Body, is very great, eſpecially with the preciſe ſtickers to the Letter: For according to theſe, Chriſt Tranſubſtantiated Bread into his Body: but here, according to the ſame Rule of interpretation, he ſhould convert his Body into Bread: the words being alike operative: But if Chriſt did at no time make a Tranſubſtantiation of his Fleſh, or body into bread, though he affirmed his Body to be bread: What reaſon is there we ſhould believe upon no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds, than he affirming bread to be his Body, ſhould thereby change it into his proper Body?</p>
                     <p>A Third principal Argument is taken from the words of Chriſt at the Celebration, <hi>viz: This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> And upon the proper acceptation of theſe words, they make no doubt to put to ſilence all ſeeming oppoſitions, and contradictions, and impoſſibilities in nature. For be it (ſay they) how it will, Chriſt ſaying it, who is truth it ſelf, no doubt is to be made of it: For as they teach the vulgar to ſpeak, If Chriſt ſhould ſay that this ſtone were his Body, we ought to believe it. All which is granted. But we muſt diſtinguiſh, as all ſober men do, between <hi>Loquela</hi> and <hi>Sermo.</hi> He that rehearſes a certain number of Articulate words doth <hi>Loqui</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Now if it can be proved by any certain Circumſtance, that Chriſt meant theſe words in a proper ſenſe, and not improper, in which he delivered no ſmall part of his doctrine in the Goſpel, we have done; the Controverſy is at an end; we are to lay our hands on our mouths and freely to conclude with them. But until this be better evinced what make they with ſo many zealous profeſſions of their believing of Chriſt, or proteſtations againſt others that herein they believe not Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="215" facs="tcp:55232:128"/>It becomes then the principal doubt of all, not what were Chriſts words but what was the drift and purpoſe of them. And ſurely they muſt needs grant this to be worthily doubted of, when they conſider how ſundry of their eminent Doctors do yield ſuch an Indifferency in the words as that they are capable of both ſenſes: as might eaſily be made apparent: But ſaying that We ought to take the Scriptures always literally where it will conſiſt with the analogy of Faith, they ſay no more than we: But if it happens (as here it doth) that our Analogy of Faith differs from theirs, what are we the neerer? For our Faith tells us, Chriſts words were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as well here as in St. <hi>John;</hi> where he expreſly teſtifies ſo much ſaying,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note> 
                        <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life:</hi> that is, ſpiritually and not properly to be underſtood: And <hi>Literal ſenſe</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand two ways, Firſt, as being the ſame as the prime ſignification of the words according to common uſe: And this Literal ſenſe we deny of theſe words. But affirm them literally to be taken, taking <hi>Literal,</hi> for that which by the ſame words was immediately and primarily intended by the ſpeaker, in which way all Metaphorical ſpeeches are Literally to be taken. For he that ſays of a vicious man, <hi>He is a Beaſt,</hi> doth literally mean that he is of beaſtly qualities, and not the very nature of a Beaſt. So that Metaphorical and Literal are not oppoſite, but Metaphorical and Natural, and Natural and Spiritual.</p>
                     <p>We ſay then, That this Propoſition as in the Euchariſt, is Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and yet Literal. But it is a weak and ſpiteful ſlander to ſay, That becauſe we ſay this, therefore we hold that Chriſts Body is only Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically and Figuratively in the Euchariſt: For we profeſs it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and properly, and really and properly received in the Sacrament; and not as they would fain perſwade the World of us, imaginarily only: But the figurativeneſs is not ſo much in the <hi>Preſence</hi> of Chriſt, as the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of Chriſt, of the viſible Elements: We ſay plainly, the Elements are Chriſt only Figuratively, and improperly: and as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath<note place="margin">Ambroſ. de Sacrament. <hi>Lib. 4. C. 4.</hi>
                        </note> it (or rather had it before a falſe Cauſe here, as elſwhere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained men to foul practiſes.) <hi>After Conſecration that which was, remains, and yet is changed into another.</hi> It retains its nature, it is changed to its name, to its uſe, and ends, and effects; and theſe are ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers who are alledged to prove Chriſt ſpake here properly, do ſpeak of many changes made in the Elements; but then they do as often deny the ſubſtance to be changed; ſometimes they ſay, <hi>The Nature is changed:</hi> but we know <hi>Nature</hi> is ſomtimes uſed more largely than to imply the very <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> it ſelf. We ſay commonly, <hi>Such a man is quite of another nature from what he was.</hi> We do not mean his very <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> is changed; but his condition. It is ſaid in the firſt Book of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. v. 9.</note> that after his anointing to the Kingdom, <hi>God gave Saul another heart.</hi> I hope not in ſubſtance but in diſpoſition.

                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones.</hi> Can any thing be more expreſly affirmed than this, to ſignifie a corporeal unity and identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Chriſt, if the Verb Copulative <hi>Are,</hi> muſt here be taken Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as they ſay <hi>Is</hi> muſt in theſe words, <hi>This Is my Body?</hi> As they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with much ardour and zeal they will believe Chriſt, ſay he what he pleaſe, and be the thing never ſo contrary to our common ſenſe and reaſon, ſo do we: And no leſs do we believe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: This he hath ſaid, and therefore we muſt not diſpute, but believe.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55232:129"/>
He hath ſaid as plainly as words can make it, that we are the very fleſh of Chriſt, and the bones of Chriſt: and that he cannot be underſtood of the ſame in Kind, but number is manifeſt from his argument when he ſaith, <hi>No man ever hated his own fleſh;</hi> but as his fleſh is anothers in nature, we know there is nothing more common. Now the like, if not ſame inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation will ſatisfy the Scripture in one place and other.</p>
                     <p>And not only ſo, but the Fathers who are urged for the literal ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words rather than Literal ſenſe of the Author of them, ſpeak diverſe times of a Real change of the foreſaid Elements; but ſaying the ſame in other caſes as in the holy <hi>Chryſm</hi> after Benediction; and ſpecially the water of Baptiſm, we would have one give meaning to the other. And the Modern Greeks who are arrived at higher expreſſions and ſenſe than their forefathers, yet when occaſion ſerves can affirm the ſubſtance of Bread and wine to remain; and would never fully receive the term [<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>] Tranſubſtantiation, as the Latins do: which declare how much they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an Evil ſenſe in the Roman Church. Again, as they are defective in their characterizing this change to that degree, ſo are they exceſſive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Latins opinions, in aſcribing too great a change upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. For they make no ſuch diſtinction, as the other between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſubſtance, and the Accidents. And they deny as much, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains any Accidents, as any ſubſtance of Bread: wherein they ſeem to take Chriſt more Literally than the Papiſts. For if (as they give out) we muſt take Chriſt at his word, and hold him hard to the Letter, we muſt and ought to do it no leſs in reference to the Accidents than the Subſtance: For Chriſt made no diſtinction, and then why ſhould we? By vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his words the Accidents muſt be changed as well as the Subſtance. And ſo in truth we believe: and to make our meaning clear will allow no effect of Chriſts words upon the one, which we will not upon the other. And if they oppoſe ſenſe to diſcriminate the Caſes, ſaying, that we ſee and feel that the <hi>Specieſes</hi> and Accidents are the ſame: We muſt tell them in their own words and that without fraud or diſſimulation, that we believe Chriſt rather than our own ſenſes: And were it not ſo, yet we cannot teil that they are the ſame individual Accidents which were before conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though like them; and appearing ſo to be.

againſt the <hi>Eutichians</hi> in theſe words, <hi>For Chriſt vouchſafed to take on him the Sacrament of Adoption, both at his Circumciſion and at his Baptiſm: and the Sacrament of Adoption may he called Adoption, as the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which is the Bread and Cup Conſecrated, we call his Body and Blood: not that properly his body is Bread, or his Blood the Cup, but that they contain in then the Myſtery of the Body and Blood of him. Whence our Lord himſelf called the Bleſſed Bread and Cup which he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Diſciples, his Body and his Blood. Wherefore as Chriſtian believers taking the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of him, are ſaid truly to take the Body and Blood of Chriſt: So Chriſt when he took the Sacrament of Adoption of Children, might truly he ſaid to take the Adoption of Children.</hi> Thus he, and <hi>Syrmondus</hi> in his notes upon this place doth confeſs theſe to be very harſh expreſſions like unto ſome of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> there mentioned.</p>

And to the eye of Faith, the conſecrated Elements<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> are the Body and Blood of Chriſt: and ſo may not unaptly be ſo called by thoſe whoſe ſenſes are exerciſed (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) to diſcern both good and evil though in nature they be farr otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Some indeed (as I conceive) have been but too free of the Figures in this queſtion, ſuppoſing that the very word <hi>Eſt,</hi> or <hi>Is</hi> muſt not be taken in its proper ſenſe, but ſtand for as much as <hi>Significat, Signifies:</hi> but this is without ground in Grammar or Divinity. For he that ſaith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>

Now there being no difference between a Similitude and a Metaphor, but that the one is at large, and in many words, what the other is in one: To ſay <hi>Chriſt is a Lamb</hi> or <hi>This</hi> (which is bread) <hi>is Chriſt,</hi> is no more than to ſay, Chriſt is <hi>as</hi> a Lamb: and Bread is <hi>as</hi> Chriſts Body: For the many agreements between the natural and Spiritual ſenſes.

                     <p>GREAT contentions have been about the Sacrifice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and perhaps, though with juſt Cauſe, yet not ſo great as is generally believed. For theſe two Terms do much illuſtrate one the other. For neither is the Altar upon which Chriſtians offer, properly an Altar, any more then (as is ſaid before) the Lords-Day now obſerved is properly a Sabbath, nor is the Sacrifice thereon performed properly a Sacrifice. Some will have that only truly called a Sacrifice which conſiſted of living Creaturs ſlain and offered to God,<note place="margin">Dixerunt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui, quia Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium non eſt niſi de Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus: et erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt in hoc, &amp;c.

For there muſt be in all things ſome one thing which is as a Rule and Law and gives denomination to others, according as they agree with it. Now if all offerings to God, as fine Flower, and fruits of the Earth, be called a Sacrifice in an equal ſence to the moſt proper, then have we no Rule to go by in Judging of Sacrifices. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi> who rejecteth the former acceptation becauſe we Read in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 20. of a <hi>Sacrifice of fine Flower:</hi> and <hi>Exodus 31.

For either theſe things and ſuch-like were more properly called <hi>Oblations</hi> than <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> or when they were called <hi>Sacrifices</hi> they were ſo called becauſe of the Proper bloudy Sacrifice as the principal thing, to which they were adjuncts.</p>

For <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt under the Law offered proper Sacrifices; but that they had peculiar Temples, or Altars, is not true.

                        </note> ſhould think fit: and make Altars at their pleaſures. though I am not ignorant that myſtical <hi>Bolducius</hi> is of another mind without ſolid grounds. But afterward, the <hi>Altar</hi> (as Chriſt intimateth in the Goſpel) <hi>Sanctified the Gift,</hi> ſo far, that it was not accepted but upon that which<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 19.</note> God had ordained for Sacrifices, or offerings to him. The caſe is not altogether ſo now under the Goſpel, that Chriſtians ſhould be abſolutely confined to the Publique Altars (as they may be called) appointed to the Euchariſt: For we do not read that ever the Apoſtles ſo Celebrated, but have great preſumptions to the Contrary. Nor doth it in like manner
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55232:130"/>
appear in the Goſpel, that thoſe places, on which they did Celebrate, were preſerved from all Secular uſes; as we do in the Law, that Altars there were. Yet ſo much ought all, who are good Chriſtans, condeſcend to the immemoriall practiſe of the Church ſeparating all ſuch ſacred things from common and vulgar uſes, and requiring to celebrate upon the Reputed and appointed Altar, that I make queſtion, whether any Sacrifice, not ſo offered, through contempt or ſullenneſs, can be either ſo acceptable to God or profitable to our ſelves as in the other received way.</p>
                     <p>And there want not as learned men who denie that Conſumption is neceſſary to a true Sacrifice: And I am ſure the Roman Cauſe ſo requires: unleſs in this ſtate, they will make Chriſt paſſible, and Corruptible; though I know they have many a Sorry ſhift to evade this too.</p>
                     <p>Now for brevity ſake, to omit many things incident to this diſpute, and to apply the Notion of Sacrifice to the Actions in the Euchariſt; If we take Sacrifice in <hi>Melancthons</hi> ſenſe, from which <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not much vary,<note place="margin">Melanct.

                        <hi>For every act and thing devoted to God, whereby we give him honour,</hi> there are Sacrifices enough to be found in the Euchariſt: And there are many known ſenſes of Sacrifice given to God, admitted by Proteſtants. But paſſing all them over, the Queſtion here muſt be ſtated concerning this Sacrifice, as it was concerning the Body of Chriſt: Not whether there Really it is, but whether it really and properly be Predicated of the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and that in as proper a ſenſe, as Chriſts Body was offered upon the Croſs: This we deny, acknowledging only theſe three things, which fully ſatisfie the expreſſions of the Ancient, calling the <hi>Hoſt</hi> an <hi>Incruent Sacrifice.</hi> Firſt, becauſe here we call to remembrance Chriſts ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, according as he Inſtituted and required that at our hands, ſaying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Secondly, as it is a Sacrifice<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19.</note> Rememorative, ſo is it a Sacrifice Repreſentative, Inſinuating and ſignifying unto as the death and Paſſion of Chriſt: and not as common ſignes and advertences only to bring to mind: or as <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi> hath it, <hi>like a String tyed about the ſinger</hi> to put a man in remembrance, and no more; but alſo to informe the Iudgment, and confirm and encreaſe the Faith of the Receiver. Thirdly, it is a Sacrifice Repreſentative to God as well as to Man: For though nothing can lie hid from him, or be forgotten by him, yet taking things as he hath been pleaſed to expreſs them unto us, after the manner of Men; he, by the offering of this Sacrifice and the devout worſhip there performed to God, is moved to behold, conſider, and accept the true Sacrifice which Chriſt made for us in offering himſelfe for us: As it was by Gods own appointment in the Rainbow put for a ſigne between him and Man of the Covenant for not drowning the earth. <hi>And the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 16.</note>

Thus is the Hoſt a Sacrifice, but not eſſentially as the ſacrifices of the Law, or Chriſts offering himſelf; but Analogically, and Metonymically, by vertue of the Sacrifice of Chriſt; and through whoſe vertue the benefits of Chriſts death, and Paſſion are made over unto the worthy Communicats agreably to Chriſts Inſtitution; and the Title given it by the Ancient and Holy Fathers.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the form of Conſecrating the Elements, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſteth. Whether only Recitative or Supplicative.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND to this duly communicating, is neceſſarily required the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Form of this Sacrament: Which Form conſiſteth in two things principally, The Proper Actions of the Miniſter of it: and the Receiver of it. The Action of the Miniſter or Prieſt conſiſteth in the due conſecration and Dedication of thoſe Elements deſigned for that end: For as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the father hath it, <hi>The word coming to the Creature maketh it a Sacrament,</hi> it gives being to it, as ſuch; which before was but common bread and wine. And that this is done by the Recitation of the hiſtorie of Chriſts Celebration and Inſtitution of them all at firſt; and Invocation of God upon the Elements, is certain: but it is not ſo certain, what ſpecial form of words is only and abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this purpoſe: nor, whether they are only Recitative, pronouncing the words of Chriſt at the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, as, <hi>This is my Body;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chriſtoph. de Cap. Fontium de Theolog. Scholaſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>format.</note> and ſo over the Cup, <hi>This is my Blood:</hi> or, whether they muſt be alſo Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative. The Greek Church and ſome of the Learnedeſt of the Roman hold the Latter to be neceſſarie, and the Former inſufficient: The moſt common Opinion of the Weſtern Church is, That the Conſecration by way of decencie and ſolemnitie, ought to conſiſt of Benedictions and Invocations of God; but that eſſentially is required nothing more than the recitation of Chriſts words over the Elements, for the real Conſecration of them. And each ſide doth rather well prove their own practiſe, than anſwer the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties oppoſed to each other. For, as the Greeks well ſay, There is no great probability that an hiſtorical narration of what was done by Chriſt, ſhould of it ſelfe be effectuall to the Converſion of the Elements from their Common uſe and nature, to the divine. For it is only expected from him that rehearſeth what another ſaid or did, that he be a faithful reporter; and not that he ſhould effectually thereby make a thing true. But on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Prayer is not ſo much <hi>Indicative,</hi> as <hi>Imperative</hi> and <hi>Impetrative.</hi> We read indeed in <hi>St Paul to Timothie,</hi> of things that <hi>are Sanctified by the word and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Prayer.</hi> But the word and Sanctification there, are no preaching or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, but only ſignify that God by the Goſpel, which is his word proper, removed the ſentence of uncleanneſſe from things ſo judged to be, under the Law, and ſet them as free, as other reputed Clean: But pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's proper Act and Office it is to bring down a ſpecial Benediction upon Sacramental and Familiar food. On the other ſide, the difference being ſo vaſt and Sacred between Common Creatures of bread and Wine, and the Sacramental, it was lookt upon as a thing of greateſt uſe and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all believers to know, whether ſuch conſecration was performed or not. But where the form was ſo looſe and indetermined as it muſt needs be, conſiſting in the various and Prolix office, belonging thereunto, how could it poſſible be diſerned when the Hoſt was conſecrated, and whether;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55232:131"/>
ſeeing neither the whole Canon could be ſaid thereunto abſolutely neceſſary; nor could it be aſſigned what part thereof eſſentially and eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually performed he Conſecration. Hereupon the Latine Church hath taken upon them to define the Converſion of the Elements into Chriſt, (for that they make Conſecration) to a very few preciſe words uſed by Chriſt at the Firſt Inſtitution of his Holy Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz: <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> And I have not found how the Arguments on either ſide can be well anſwered; while the Opinion of tranſ-elementation, or ſuch ſuppoſed converſion, ſtands Good; and is accepted: but otherwiſe it is no hard matter to anſwer Both. For (ſuppoſing not a change of the proper natures and ſubſtances of the Elements into the Body of Chriſt naturall, What inconvenience would it be, to be undetermined by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of words, when the myſtical change was wrought, granting that this change Relative is made by the word and Prayer, as the change of water in baptiſm is made not by any ſpecial number or form of words, but by the Office, whether longer or ſhorter? And therefore the neceſſitie of putting the whole virtue in thoſe few words recited, was received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which is an argument that the Greek Church never admitted it, in the Latin ſenſe; however, I know, they would not in their Councels, contend with them about that; but kept themſelves to the tradition of their Predeceſſors, who reſtrained not the Conſecration to ſuch number of words; but muſt have with the like pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and neceſſity have done ſo, had they ſo apparently and expreſly received ſuch a ſimple converſion as being true, all Chriſtians ought to be ſo punctually aſſured of, and venerate, that nothing in their Creed could be more neceſſary; and not contented themſelves with the Relative change only of the things themſelves: which preciſely to know, ſtood them not ſo much in hand; ſeeing the Reverence given to the Viſible objects could not exceed that communicable to Creatures. It may be granted therefore that the words of Chriſt are ſo neceſſary that Conſecration cannot rightly be performed without them; but yet denied to be ſo operative, that upon the plain recitation of them, they ſhould preſently effect that great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: as the Story (I make no doubt) feigned to beget belief of this new opinion implieth, telling us, That certain Shepheards while it was the cuſtom to pronounce the Canon of the Maſs openly, having learned it,<note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the Participation of this Sacrament in both Kinds. The vanity of Papists allegations to the Contrary. No Sacramental Receiving of Chriſt in One kind only. How Antiquity is to be underſtood mentioning the receiving of one Element only. The pretended inconveniences of partaking in both kinds inſufficient. Of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Euchariſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SECOND Thing formally neceſſary to this Sacrament; which is Celebration in both Kinds; or Bread and Wine. In treating whereof we muſt do ſo much Juſtice to the Cauſe, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a reaſonable diſtinction between the Sacrament it ſelf, and the Communicants in it. To the former, I ſuppoſe, it is agreed that indiſpenſably both Elements are neceſſary, and Eſſential: and that there can be no Sacrament without them both, whatever ſolemnity may be acted to the eye, or ear. For the Sacrament no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> being a thing of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force or vertue, but inſtituted, the very formality of the Inſtitution conſiſting in the joint concurrence of both Elements, the Removing of One is the Adulteration of the Whole, and deſtruction: neither can that be ſaid to be a Sacrament of Chriſts Inſtitution; but, if at all, of mans deviſing. Neither do I ſee how the argument ſhould not hold in the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of that Sacrament, as well as Conſecration, <hi>viz:</hi> that, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration in one Kind only maketh not a Sacrament; ſo communication in one Kind, where both are in being, ſhould be receiving the Sacrament. For the natures of things, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it, are like numbers, which with the addition or Subſtraction of one, change their kind. We do not make Bread of the Nature of Wine; or on the contrary: but we make them both equally of the nature of that Sacrament, which by Chriſts own Inſtitution was an Aggregate thing conſtituted of both: and therefore to withdraw, or deny one is in effect to deny both. And the Evaſion to ſalve this is both ridiculous and prophane, which ſaith, <hi>The blood is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Body of Chriſt; and therefore in taking one, both are received.</hi> But 'tis nothing ſo. For the Blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament is no more contained in the Body, than the Body in the blood. And beſides, we ſay, that he who not at all receives the Cup, cannot at all receive the ſignified body of Chriſt, but only the ſignifying. Again, How can this aſſertion conſiſt with the opinion of an <hi>Incruent Sacrifice?</hi> For either the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Body of Chriſt hath Blood in it, or it hath not. If it hath, then is it a Bloody, and not <hi>Incruent</hi> Sacrifice. (For I think there is no ground for a man to ſay a Sacrifice was called Bloody or Cruent, becauſe only Blood was ſhed before it was Sacrificed, and not becauſe, even at that time it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55232:132"/>
blood in it: For <hi>Cruent</hi> and <hi>Incruent</hi> are the ſame in the Law, from whence the Goſpel borrows this Phraſe, as <hi>Animate</hi> and <hi>Inanimate</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:) If it hath not, how can it be ſaid to have the blood of Chriſt alſo? Muſt not they be neceſſitated here to ſlee to an unknown Concomitance the one of the other, and not a coexiſtence? And if thus: the blood hath the fleſh of Chriſt concomitantly, as well as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leſh the blood: and ſo for this reaſon might the Cup be received without the Bread. But we poſitively deny both ſuch Carnal, Capernaitical Coexiſtence as is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and ſuch neceſſary Concomitance too, that with the receiving of one alone, the other ſhould be neceſſarily taken alſo: but hold rather, where both are not Preſent, both are abſent; and no Sacramental Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt can poſſibly be hoped for. And though I have been long of this opinion before I found any authority expreſs to this purpoſe, beſides the very intrinſique nature of the Sacrament it ſelf, now touched; Yet am I not alone. For thus ſpeaks a Reverent and Learned Father of our Church. <hi>In all compounded things, the moiety of the matter is the moiety of ſubſtance:</hi>

                        <hi>And whatſoever Jeſuited Romaniſts teach, I ſee not how their Laicks can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that they have at any time in all their Lives been partakers of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: for if half a man be not a man, then likewiſe, half a Communion is not a Communion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But were there more colour, (for nothing of reality do we find in their Offers to vindicate themſelves) in what is ſaid for the poſſibility of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in one Kind received: What can be ſaid for their groſs abuſe of their and our Lords Inſtitution, and their Relinquiſhing the unanimous practice of the Catholick Church for ſo many Ages together? Did not Chriſt equally inſtitute both? Did he not equally communicate both to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?

Did Chriſt any where make two Inſtitutions, One For Prieſts, and another for Laicks? If but one, Who ſhould preſume to alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The meaning of Chriſt being as plain as any thing need be, that there ſhould ſo often be had a devout remembrance of him, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and not imply, as is moſt boldly inſinuated, that ſometimes we may not communicate in the Sacramental bloud of Chriſt.

The Church of God for above 1200 years did conſtantly and univerſally practiſe both. And until the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> about the year 1415 many in the Roman Church ſo received: but then it was violently taken away. But to this very day all Churches not ſubdued to the Roman, continue the Ancient form.

This, I grant, was ſometimes performed by the ſending to ſuch, the Conſecrated Element of Bread in the Euchariſt: Not with an opinion of the Fathers of the Church, however poſſibly ſame vulgar and ignorant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might have too high a conceit of it; that ſuch receiving was <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamount</hi> to the receiving in both Kinds Sacramentally. But to their inconveniences, which are many of them more fit to make ſport, than to ſway in ſo grave a Controverſie, we ſhall only reply that all they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg was no newes to their, and our Predeceſſours; and yet never could it enter into their hearts to attempt ſo monſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the truth is, the Errour of tranſubſtantiation being throughly received, occaſioned this, by way of common prudence, as well as Chriſtian devotion. For it being firmly and clearly believed, the Conſecrated Elements became Chriſts Bodie and Blood, forſaking wholely their own Nature; Common Reaſon required that all poſſible reſpect and Care ſhould be taken, as far as the wit of man could reach, that no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or indignity ſhould be done to them: and that then became indecent and prophane which before was not.

dayes of Chriſtianity, there was an Elevation of the Myſteries made by the Prieſt, to ſhew only how Chriſt was Lifted up on the Croſs, for our ſins: but upon the doctrine and perſwaſion of tranſubſtantiation, this was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and perverted to the drawing people to a direct Adoration termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Viſible objects; and not, as was anciently uſed from that Action, to take an occaſion of worſhipping Chriſt himſelf, with a ſeqeſtration of their mind from their ſenſes.

                     <p>VVHile we treat of the Church, it muſt be alwaies remembred that we intend not to ſpeak of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church, as it is taken for a ſelect number ſuppoſed to belong intimately and inſeparably to Chriſts inviſible Body, of which no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or account can be had, but by ſenſible outward things: but we altogether enquire of the Viſible Church which though it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Actually ſeen, or diſcerned from other Societies (eſpecially pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Churches of Chriſt) yet muſt alwaies be Viſible; though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious.

ſame Church: the Church in nature being but One; according to ſeveral teſtimonies of Holy-Writt; and the very nature of all Communities, and much more of the Church, which is to be an Aggregate Body conſiſting of many parts, by no natural Bond or influence united together, but by divine<note place="margin">Falſae Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Imagine utimur ſi cujus nomine gloria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur ejus insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. <hi>Leo.

Which is manifeſted by certain outward Acts, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and denominates ſuch a ſociety of Men, Viſible, as a Church of Chriſt. Theſe Acts are principally two The profeſſion and declaration in word or writing of the true Faith, and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of thoſe Graces and workes which that Faith requires in Religious worſhip and Obedience. That, and in what degree of neceſſitie this Church muſt be One as well as Viſible, is before declared; and here only repeated to give light to the nature of Schiſme, now to be explained. For to omit the Criticiſmes, and various acceptations of the word <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as not neceſſarie; we ſhall proceed by degrees to ſhew theſe two things concerning it, The Nature, and Guilt of it.</p>
                     <p>For the Nature of Schiſm; it doth appear from the Unitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Chriſts Body, of the Church, conſiſting in two things; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt the Head, and mutual Communion of the members one with another: the contrary to this muſt needs be Diſcommunion and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But there being two parts in Communion, <hi>a Material,</hi> or the things in which men communicate, as faith it ſelfe, and the ſubſtantial Part of Chriſtian worſhip: And a <hi>Formal,</hi> the Actual outward exerciſe of this: The Firſt of theſe, though it be really, yet is not formally Schiſm, as may appear more fully by and by: becauſe all Schiſm doth ſuppoſe ſome agreement with, and Relation to that One Body, the Church: but where the foundation of ſuch Relation is deſtroyed, there the whole periſhes. And therefore a diviſion from the Faith of Chriſts bodie, the Church, being either Total, and that again either <hi>Negatively,</hi> when a man never was inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that Stock, is more properly called Atheiſm, or Heatheniſm, or <hi>Privative,</hi> and then is called Apoſtaſie, which is a profeſſed renunciation of the Faith once received. Or this Diviſion is Partial, and ſo it takes the name of Hereſie upon it. Schiſm then muſt needs be an outward Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Communion of the Church. But when we ſay Schiſm is a Separation, we do not mean ſo ſtrictly, as if it conſiſted in the Act of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating, ſo much as the State: For we do not call any man a Schiſmatique, who ſometimes refuſes to communicate with the Church in its outward worſhip, though that done wilfully is a direct way to it, (as all frequented Actions do at length terminate in habits of the ſame Nature) but it is rather a <hi>State</hi> of ſeparation; and of Diſſolution of the continuitie of Church; in a moral or divine ſenſe, not natural, which we ſeek into at preſent.</p>
                     <p>This Separate State then being a Relation of Oppoſition, as the other was of Conjunction; the Term denominating and ſignallizing both, is to be enquired unto: And that is inſinuated alreadie, and muſt needs be, the Church; and that as that is united unto Chriſt; or the true Church. For there is no ſeparation from that which really is not, though it may ſeem to be. It muſt therefore be a true Church from whence Schiſmatical ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made. So far do they confute and confound themſelves who excuſe their Schiſmaticalneſs from that which principally conſtitutes Schiſm, and Schiſmaticks, <hi>viz.</hi> an acknowledgement of that to be a true Church from which they divide themſelves, and ſeparate.</p>
                     <p>Again, We are to note that Separation is either of Perſons and Churches in Co-ordination, or ſubordination: according to that excellent and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

From whence it is manifeſt, that though all Schiſm be a Separation yet all Separation is not a Schiſm.

Yet do they err alſo, that from hence conclude that the Formal reaſon of Schiſm conſiſts in Separating a mans ſelf; for it is rather the material Cauſe than formal. The formal Cauſe being (as in all other things) the very Conſtitution it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with unreaſonableneſs and uncharitableneſs.

                        <hi>of the Interpreters of the Canon Law, and of the Summiſts is that the Heretick differs from the Schiſmatick, in that, Every Heretick is a Schismatick, but not on the contrary: Which they prove becauſe the term Shiſmatick, ſignifies Diviſion. But every Heretick turns away ſeparates, divides himſelf from the Church.</hi> This
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55232:135"/>
is very plain and reaſonable: and ſo is the conſequence from hence: That where the Body is ſo corrupt, as to be really infected with notorious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, there it is really (ſo far as it is erroneous) ſeparated from the true Church; and where it is ſo far ſeparated from the true Church, ſo far it is Schiſmatical. And when a Church is thus far really Schiſmatical, little or no Scruple is to be made of an outward Separation: neither can a guilt be affixed unto it. And on the other ſide, if no ſuch real ſeparation, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Guilt can be found in a Church, in vain do diverſe betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that ſpecious Shift and evaſion, <hi>that they were caſt out, and went not out willingly from a Church: and that they are willing to return, but are not ſuffered.</hi> For undoubtedly the very ſuppoſition is inſincere and faulty; that they forſook not the Church, before they were ejected; And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion followed ſeparation and diſſention from it; and was not rather the Effect than Cauſe of them; as are all excommunications rightly uſed. For to thoſe that pretend they were turned out, do not the doors ſtand open to receive them, and that with thanks, if they pleaſe to re-enter, and re-unite, themſelves. What do they here alledge in there excuſe and Defence? They are readie to return, but they cannot be admitted but upon unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Terms and conditions. How does this appear if it ſhould be denied, as without all peradventure it will? Muſt not the Defendents be here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take their grounds of Apologie and Juſtification from the very things themſelves, under debate, and put in their exceptions againſt the terms upon which they are to be receiv'd, or condemn themſelves? Neither will it ſuffice to ſay, We ſhall be hardly uſed, or beaten, if we return to ſuch ſevere Maſters, and therefore we will keep out. For they may deſerve it: and though nature teacheth a man, as it did <hi>Hagar,</hi> to flee from her Miſtris <hi>Sarahs</hi> Tents, for fear of blows, yet God and Juſtice, and Chriſtian Charity adviſe us to return to our Duty. It muſt then be neceſſarily alledged and made good, That we deſerve not to be ſo ill uſed; or rather that it is ill uſage which we fore-ſee: ſhall befall us and that, the caſe ſo ſtanding, it is not our duty to return: and all this can no waies poſſible be made good, but by examination of the matter it ſelf And that which will Juſtifie us from not returning will alſo warrant our free Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration at firſt. Tis the cauſe then that makes the Separation, Schiſm, or not. An Inſtance whereof we have in the famous Schiſm of the Donatiſts: which almoſt all Chriſtians now adays confeſs to have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Schiſmaticks, becauſe they could not make good their Reaſons which induced them: for could they, they had not been Schiſmaticks; as a ſober Author notes upon <hi>Optatus</hi> thus; <hi>If thoſe things were true which</hi>

                        <hi>the Donatiſts laid to Caecilianus, and Menſurius and Caecilianus had polluted themſelves with Idolatry, The Donatiſts had offended nothing againſt the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Canons of the Church, refuſing to communicate with Caecilianus and his Companions.</hi> That is, they had not been Schiſmaticks, if ſo be they could have made good their Principal Charges againſt the Church.</p>
                     <p>And this we may bring home to our ſelves, as now we ſtand devided from other Churches, and particularly that of Rome. For if the Corruptions in doctrine and Practice be not ſufficient to juſtifie our preſent poſture of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: if they had not before we left them, departed from the true faith; if they were not really and materially Schiſmatiques before we were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from them; then ſurely we were, at our ſeparation, and ſo continue. For to ſay, We have a willing mind to unity, we have Charity ſo great that we earneſtly deſire Reconciliation with them, is to deceive the world,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55232:136"/>
and our ſelves and encourage and juſtify Schiſm in others, who no doubt will all pretend to ſo much charity as to declare themſelves willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace unity upon their own terms. But in ſuch caſes we cannot be ſaid to go to them, though in outward apparence we may ſeem ſo to do, as they come to us. The queſtion therefore is to be put under the circumſtances as now they are, and as the Caſe is now with them. And in that it ought, and may be roundly and reſolutely anſwer'd, We neither can, nor ought, nor will re-unite; and yet well enough free our ſelves from Schiſm, upon the account of the Juſtneſs of the occaſions and Cauſes there found, and given us, to divide from them.</p>
                     <p>Then ought it to be enquired (for this they paſſionately call for) what are thoſe errors which that Church is ſubject to, for which a Separation may be Legitimated, and not participate of the nature of Schiſm. It is commonly and with general conſent averted, (and that even by leaving Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks amongſt us,) That Corruption in Act or manners is not ſufficient to warrant a Separation from a Church ſubject to them, and ſo infected; no not perhaps though Idolatry it ſelf ſhould be too common amongſt them, in it; when no neceſſity lies upon the particular Members, to be obnoxious to the ſame; the doctrine of Chriſt bearing up its head above it, and obeyed truly by others. But when Evil actions, and notorious errours in Fact ſhall come to that height as to be reduced to doctrine, and formed into an heretical or Idolatrous propoſition, as in time it muſt of neceſſity be, (it being natural, as well to all Churches, as perſons to defend by argument what they chooſe to practiſe,) and be taught publickly, then doth that Church become truly Heretical and Idolatrous, and from that Church which hath ſo far departed from the Faith, any Church or perſon may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully depart without Scruple of Schiſm, though ſuch ſeparation be not abſolutely neceſſarie: becauſe, though the infection be common, it is not neceſſarily ſo general, that all ſhould be obliged to eſpouſe it, and be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by it; but when to this degree of doctrine, ſhall be added a third, which is of Precept, and ſuch unſound and pernicious opinions ſhall be impoſed on others, and exacted of all, there it is not only lawful but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, to divide from ſuch a pretended Church of Chriſt: I mean a neceſſity of <hi>Precept,</hi> though not of <hi>Means:</hi> as if it were not poſſible that a man ſhould be ſaved who liveth in an Heretical or Idolatrous Church, though with thoſe many circumſtances of a general Right Intention, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walking with God, and invincible ignorance of the more pure and Chriſtian Faith and worſhip.</p>
                     <p>For there is undoubtedly a Mean between theſe two, Neceſſity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Neceſſity of Damnation. Well might <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſay, <hi>Whoſoever will be ſaved it is neceſſary that he hold the Catholick Faith:</hi> and add yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Which Faith except a man do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he ſhall periſh everlaſtingly; and ſo</hi> give us the particulars of that Faith, ſo neceſſary. For he means no more than, that ſuch Errors are in themſelves damnable: But hereſies do not work after the manner of ſuch natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which have ſuch effects infallibly, but may be ſaid notwithſtanding naturally to tend to ſuch events, which yet may be prevented by various Allayes of Circumſtances both inward and outward, impeding ſuch Effects. The Conſideration of which poſſibility of eſcaping the ordinary danger, can no ways excuſe a man or confirm him in ſuch errours, but the common; and, as you may ſay, natural tendence, of them to ruine and perdition, ſtrongly oblige him to relinquiſh that Church wherein it is only poſſible, by vertue

of ſome extraordinarie indulgence of God, to come to ſalvation; and whoſe errours are of themſelves damnable. So if the Queſtion be put (as generally it is) Whether (for example) a man may not be ſaved in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church? The anſwer is abundantly ſufficient within Religion and Divinitie; though perhaps not ſo formal in Logick, That <hi>they certainly may be damn'd,</hi> and that for holding the Faith and worſhip there commanded, and received with full approbation. And this is ſufficient to call any ſober Chriſtian off from that communion; though there may occur ſo many mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Circumſtances, as to a Perſon of that communion, which may detain any man of Chriſtian modeſty and Charity from pronouncing ſuch an one to be infallibly damn'd, or out of poſſibility to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>And if it be hereupon demanded, What difference we put between Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and ſuch corrupt Chriſtians, ſeeing diverſe have undertaken to aſſert a Poſſibility of ſalvation to them alſo, living exactly to the Light and Rule of Nature in them; I anſwer, not abſolutely at preſent daſhing the argument a-pieces by denying the ſuppoſition, and their colourable proofs thereof, but demonſtrating a vaſt diſcrimination between the one, and other condition. For commonly, where Hereſies which are ſo properly called, and not Gentiliſm (as they are which deſtroy the firſt Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity) are taught, and maintained, there are to be found all truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſalvation, in a Chriſtian ſenſe.

Of which we have alreadie ſpoken. It being a common rule amongſt the Ancients,<note place="margin">Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.

                     <p>From hence it doth appear, how uncertain and confuſed their notion and poſition is, who without any more adoe, conclude all thoſe to be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks (and that upon their own Principles and Conceſſions) who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

from a Chriſtian Societie which they acknowledge to be a true Church. For very great is the ambiguity both of <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>True Church.</hi> Firſt, Separation is (as we have before noted) either of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinates, or Co-ordinates. And of Subordinates, either ſimply, or with Reſtriction. Simply ſubordinate I call them not comparitively with Chriſts Imperial Power, but with all External power, who by divine Right of Providence, owe direct obedience to their Paſtours in all things, not inhibited by the Law of God, to which all Spiritual Paſtours are to be no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſs ſubject than the ſheep themſelves. And thus every Biſhop is true Head and Governor of that Flock which, under Chriſt, is committed to his Care and Cuſtodie: But in like manner is not that Biſhop ſubject to the Metropolitane, and much leſs, that Metropolitane to his Patriarch. For theſe are but Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, and of no diſtinct Order, though Degree. According to which obligations of obeying, the refuſing to obey, and diſ-uniting ones ſelf from the Governours of the Church, doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or extenuate the Diviſion; and the guilt thereof. And without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure may one Church divide from another, upon leſs grounds then the Members of one Church ſeparate from the more immediate Head of the ſame. How thick do inſtances ſtand in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Churches, who by vertue of their Reſpective Governours, have been divided, and yet both remain true Churches. Again, a True Church is ſaid ſo to be more than one way: <hi>viz.</hi> As to Being <hi>abſolutely;</hi> and Being <hi>perfectly.</hi> We know that every Errour in Doctrine, though great, nay though heretical, doth not preſently deſtroy the nature of a Church abſolutely, though it takes away from the perfection of a Church.

                        </note> ſhewed in part, ſpeaking of Hereſie: and now may add farther; that the the ſame perſons of old, or their Co-equals, denied an Heretique to be a Chriſtian alſo: and therefore they are to be underſtood of the ſuch foul and unchriſtian Hereſies which raſed the foundation of faith it ſelf: as did the Valentinians, the Gnoſticks, the Marcionites and ſuch like: For tis now agreed to, That unleſs a man be a Chriſtian, he cannot be an Heretique; Or if at any time they ſpake of more tolerable Hereſies, not wholly inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity it ſelf; then they laid the burden of Damnation upon that acceſſorie, but ſeparable Aggravation, <hi>Uncharitableneſs:</hi> which alone, and eſpecially conjoined with ſuch errours, expoſed to damnation. But as it is with the Natural Man, it is with the Spiritual: There are ſome parts Eſſential, and Vital, which cannot be wanting or corrupted, but the Whole muſt looſe its nature and denomination: and there are others not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Eſſential, which are called Integral, without which the Body may poſſible ſubſiſt, but not be perfect in its material Parts. And ſo it is with the Body of Faith conſiſting of ſo many Articles, or members, as Parts; ſome Vital and eſſential; ſome neceſſarie to its perfections; but not its Being abſolutely. And a Church may be called a true Church which is defective or Exceſſive in theſe, though not in them. And yet we need not betake our ſelves to that explication by ſome uſed, of a True-man and a Thief, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs how a Church may be a True Church and an erroneous one, at the ſame time. For the nature of this truth we aſcribe unto the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting only in Morality; If the Church failes in that, the Nature of it failes, as it doth not in a man when he is corrupted with falſneſs and vice: But this we ſay, That although all Truths are equally true, as to the nature of Truth it ſelf, they are not of equal importance and uſe to us, or to a Church.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55232:137"/>
Therefore ſuch a Latitude being in the notion of a True Church, how can any man ſo confidently ſay that, <hi>No Church can ſeparate from the Church of Rome but they muſt make themſelves thereby Schiſmatiques before God, though before the Church they cannot be condemned for ſuch,</hi> qualifying this hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this Suppoſition only, <hi>That the Church of Rome alwayes had and hath Salvation in it, as a true Church, though corrupted.</hi> For that we may, and do call a True Church, wherein the principles of Chriſtianity are kept intire, as to the moſt fundamental of them: but withal, this hinders not, but diverſe things at the ſame time, and by the ſame Church which are damnable, may be found in it. For in the ſame houſe ſaith St <hi>Paul, there are Veſsels to honour and diſhonour:</hi> which we may as well interpret of Tenets of faith, as of the Profeſſours of the Faith. And in the ſame Diſpenſato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, are both Poiſons and Cordials: yea, in the ſame diſh may be found Food ſufficient to nouriſh and deſtroy; ſhall we therefore not be careful to avoid the whole, becauſe we do acknowledge the wholeſomneſs of ſo many in it. Who knowes not that there are monſtrouſneſſes in Exceſs as well as defect? And that it ſuffices not to keep a man in communion with a Church; that all things neceſſary are therein contained; when withal many things not only unneceſſary, but pernicious are ſhuffled together with them. If we can therefore ſhew, (as we ſuppoſe we have and can) that the Roman Church alloweth and propoundeth many heretical dogmes, many Idololatrical practiſes; what will it avail them to have it granted them that all truths are extant there in the Monuments of their Church? It will here infallibly be replied by them, That it cannot be that a Church at the ſame time can hold all things needful in Faith, and worſhip, and yet maintain ſuch errours as are charged upon them. To which I ſay, and grant, That 'tis not poſſible they ſhould hold the ſame things as contrary, or appearing ſo unto them: But really they may, and actually doe. Firſt, as Philoſophers ſhould of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries <hi>In gradu remiſso,</hi> not <hi>Intenſo,</hi> In the remiſſer and lower degrees, not the extremeſt. Secondly, They may hold contraries really, though not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and as contrary. For inſtance, They may hold this fundamental opinion, <hi>That God alone is to be worſhipped with that divine worſhip which is the ſupreameſt of all:</hi> And they may hold that ſuch a thing (for example) the <hi>Hoſt</hi> is very God, which verily is not God; and conſequently may teach the worſhip of ſuch a reputed God. Their Churches faith if it teaches ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly that only the true God is to be worſhipped, is inviolate, and ſound in <hi>Theſis:</hi> But their Perſwaſion that ſuch this is, is an errour in fact, rather than in Faith; which contradicts the former opinion really. But we hold, That it is neceſſary to ſalvation that we erre not in ſuch groſs facts, though we abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, deteſt, and renounce the ſin never ſo ſolemnly. And the like may we ſay in many points of difference between us and them: when they hold the propoſition in General, ſound, and good; but by help of infinite and unintelligible diſtinctions, word it out, and ware off the imputation, but not the Guilt of Errour. Of the number of which things hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is that conſideration of <hi>Schiſm before God,</hi> and <hi>Schiſm before the Church,</hi> with an implication that Separation from a true Church makes men Schiſmaticks before God, though not before men: becauſe (for example,) The Church of Rome cannot oblige any body to ſtand to the Autority, which it ſo abaſeth; namely, by breaking the Canons of the Church. It is true, A Church or Man may be a Schiſmatick before God, and not before the Church. But it cannot poſſibly be imagined how a man can be a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique before men and from men, and not before God. But if it could be,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55232:138"/>
were we not in a very fair way to hell, if we had no more to anſwer for than our Schiſm before God? Were not our whole Church Schiſmatical, and as good as loſt, though men took no notice of it. It doth not follow therefore, neither is it confeſſed, that all are Schiſmaticks who ſeparate from a true Church, unleſs the ſeparation be from it, <hi>As it is true.</hi> For we have ſhown, that a Church true in eſſentials, may fail in Integrals: And it is no hard matter to ſhow that a Church Erring in doctrines conſtituting the body of Faith, may be ſeparated from, without Schiſm. And the reaſon proving this is, becauſe that ſuch Churches are alreadie <hi>really</hi> Schiſmatical, through the ſaid errours: and it is not only lawful, but a duty to ſeparate from Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. For ſo ſaith St. <hi>Paul, We command you brethern in the name of the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</hi> And what Traditions, do we think St <hi>Paul</hi> intendeth there. Only Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and decrees of Councils for the better Government of the Catholick Church. That this he may mean I denie not; but that no more, I denie. For he that offends againſt the Faith, offends againſt the Traditions <hi>To</hi> the Church; but he that breaks the Conſtitutions, offends againſt the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Of</hi> the Church only, which are of far inferiour nature. It may well be doubted, whether breaking of the Canons of the Church only can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a Separation from a Church: becauſe they are not ſo much the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions delivered <hi>To</hi> the Church by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as the Traditions <hi>Of</hi> the Church, which in their nature are mutable. But yet if any co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Church ſhall refuſe to innovate, but ſtick reſolutely and firmly to the received Diſcipline and Lawes of the Church, while others ſhall violate them and chooſe new Forms, and impoſe new Conditions of communion with it, not agreeable to the old, upon which a ſchiſm followes; ſurely the guilt of Schiſm is to fall only upon that Church which thus innovates. For though I am apt to believe that ſuch alterations may not be ſufficient to juſtifie a renunciation of Communion with ſuch an Innovating Church, (and much leſs in ſingle perſons and private members of the ſame Church) yet doubtleſs it fully excuſes from the guilt of Schiſm, if it patiently and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively perſiſts in the more ancient and conformable way to the Churches of Chriſt in paſt ages, even with apparent peril of Schiſm: provided that the ſaid Traditional Laws and practices ſhall not by the more judicious and conſpicious part of the Church aſſembled freely, and Lawfully in Council be judged inconvenient, and ſo according to the Right it hath to reverſe or eſtabliſh things in nature alterable declar'd void; and introduce new. For in ſuch caſes, diſowning of the Power and Autority of the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the decrees thereof tending to the General unitie of it, is of it ſelf a Schiſmatical Act. But in notorious errours in Doctrine or Faith, it is free for any particular Church to divide from another: becauſe ſuch corruption is of ſelfe damnable: And in ſuch caſes we need not ſay to extenuate, I know not what unkindneſs, or perhaps incivility, <hi>we were driven out from ſuch communion, and went not out of our ſelves;</hi> but may declare Franckly, We voluntarily choſe to relinquiſh ſuch communion, ſo condition'd. Now ſuch errours we may well charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with, even while we hold it to be a true Church, in the ſenſe above expreſſed, <hi>viz. Eſsentially</hi> true, but not <hi>Integrally.</hi> For ſo a Monſtrous man may beget a truly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſon; and out of the Loyns of the Corrupt Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Perfect Church. And he that holds that a man may, even now when it is much more definitive and expreſs in its errours then itwas about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55232:138"/>
years ago, when it met firſt with that Oppoſition which it could never maſter as yet, be ſaved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may hold there are many damnable errours in it, which in their nature do damn, yet do not alwayes actually damn, as is ſaid. And this doth altogether vindicate ſuch Churches as directly leave them, provided they leave ſuch their errours only; and not extravagantly hurry themſelves into contrary errours, out of deteſtation to theirs. And this doth lay a neceſſity upon ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them to deſert them, and a much greater upon ſuch as are at preſent, alienated from them, to preſerve themſelves from ſuch imminent dangers, though not infallibly deſtroying the ſoul.</p>

                     <p>But to this adding ſuch, to us, manifeſt errours and corruptions in Faith and practiſe as have been introduced into that Church, there can be no juſt Scruple made of Separating, and to profeſs ſo much, without mincing the matter by certain fine evaſions which ſtrictly enquired into will no more ſatisfie than down-right dealing; which chargeth them with ſuch heretical-Dogmes, which contrary to Charity as well as Verity require Separation. Of the many of which that of Tranſubſtantiation may claim the firſt place together with its long Train of Groſs abuſes, and Errours following upon, and flowing from it. For though I know diverſe Learned men of our Church do look upon it as a very abſurd falſity in matter of Fact, rather then of Faith: yet if it be conſidered as reduced to Propoſitions invented and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly aſſerted to maintain that Errour in fact, it putteth on the nature of Hereſie too. To ſay that Chriſt had but one hand, is not an Hereſie of it ſelf: but a notorious non-truth in matter of Fact: But ſo to defend this opinion as thereby to deny Chriſt to have been of the ſame nature with us, amounts to Hereſie. Granting likewiſe, that not only Chriſts Natural Body is in that Sacrament, but it is that very thing which after Conſecration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares (though not as it appears) to our ſenſes is but a fowl abſurdity, and errour in point of Fact. Yet when it is ſo defended, as to call in queſtion the truth of Chriſts divine nature, and to commend and command the direct worſhip of thoſe objects ſo miſtaken; then certainly it is Hereſie, and ſomewhat more. And ſo their doctrine of Communicating in one Kind, contrary to all the mention we have of celebrating the Euchariſt in the Scriptures, and thoſe deſerving the name of Fathers in the Church; may rightly be termed Heretical, when it ſhall be drawn into ſuch a Propoſition as this (as of neceſſity it muſt,) <hi>viz. That it is of equal vertue and uſe to receive the Sacrament in one kind alone, as both Kinds:</hi> whereas only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the uſe of it, is no more than an unjuſt and ſacrilegious piece of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny over the Laicks. To theſe it were eaſie to add more of like natures as ſufficient Grounds to leave ſuch a Church as maintains them.</p>
                     <p>But for thoſe who are not in Epiſcopal, nor yet ſo much as Metropolitan ſubordination and ſubjection to that Church, but only Patriarchal (which obliges cheifly, if not only, to a recognition of a Remote Right of Order, and Principle of unity, when the Church is united, in bringing them to Councels and keeping them to thoſe Laws which are preſcribed by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſent of the Church) and this not originally, by firſt planting and forming a Chriſtian Church in a Nation, but reſtoring and augmenting it, the caſe is yet more plain, that it is free for ſuch Churches to relinquiſh communion of any Church ſubject to leſs Errours than are properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Hereſies. But for perſons educated in a Church and thereby ſubject to it, and owing Canonical obedience not only (as they moſt weakly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly imagine) to the Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> therein aſſerted, and maintained but to the Rule of <hi>Unity</hi> and Communion outward, for ſuch; I ſay, to divide
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55232:139"/>
from that Church which hath not by falling into notorious Hereſies or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous practices, firſt fallen from Chriſtian Faith, is to profeſs Schiſm. For to alledg that they would incorporate with the Church, if certain things which may poſſibly be parted with without deſtroying the Faith, at leaſt immediately were granted to them, is to demand that their Superiors ſhould bow to them, rather than they to their Superiors, and in effect to make the condition of their obedience and uniting with the Church, to be this, That firſt the Church ſhould be of their Religion; the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them conſiſting in things in their own nature mutable. For though Faith conſiſteth in thoſe things which are judged neceſſary in themſelves to be received: Yet Religion is made up as well of the manner of ſerving God, as the material grounds of it. And therefore it is according to the manner of their treaties of peace in other Caſes, to require the thing in debate to be granted them, before they will bear of a commodation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. This ſenſeleſs Charity is that of moſt Deſperate Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                     <p>Yet not abſolutely to deſpair of reducing ſome few of them, and much leſs of preventing the like ruine of ſouls in others, we ſhall now conclude with a few words concerning the <hi>Second</hi> thing in the beginning of this Point, <hi>viz. The guilt of Schiſm.</hi> Suppoſing then, what is above ſaid, that Schiſm is a Cauſeleſs Separation from the Church of Chriſt, meaning by Cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, not want of all reaſons, or cauſes, but <hi>Sufficient,</hi> as are errours now mention'd in Faith; we farther underſtand by <hi>Separation,</hi> not that of the inward and hidden man, but outward and Viſible; anſwerable to that we have called, and acknowledged to be properly called a Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For poſſible we grant it is, what we do ſcarce believe to be actually true, (though we hear ſuch things ſometimes ſpoken) that diſſenters may have a tolerable good opinion of a Church, as that it is a true Church in their private ſenſes; they may pretend ſome general kindneſs and Charity to the Members of it: Nay they may hold it no grievous ſin to communicate with it, for ſome perſons eſpecially: and yet for all this be rank Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. For Schiſmatizing in its remoter Cauſe may ſpring from evil opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and diſpoſitions of the inward man; but its formality is altogether in outward profeſſion of averſeneſs, ſeparation, and oppoſition to a Church. This is it which hath raiſed ſo much juſt clamour of the Ancient, and even of thoſe very modern Perſons who ſtomach nothing more than to be reduced to their own general Rules; and have worthily brandiſhed their ſwords and pens to bring people to the unity of that Cauſe, which never was the true Faith, and to that Viſible Company which never was a Church; and yet cannot underſtand their own language nor receive their own reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in Caſes infinitely more capable of ſuch vindications, than the Party they created and aſſerted. Herein ſurely they have exceeded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Factions in immodeſty and undauntedneſs, that whereas thoſe have been very ſcrupulous and ſparing in delivering doctrines of coercion and conſtraint to unity, and therefore may (though with no reaſon, with ſome little colour) ſtand out againſt Unity, and oppoſe all Coaction thereunto: They of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Sect have preach'd, ſpoken, and written ſo much, and expreſly againſt Schiſm, and the Liberty which tends neceſſarily to it, that it is beyond not only reaſon, but admiration, they ſhould neither be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what other men have ſaid againſt them, nor what they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably ſaid againſt themſelves, but proceed no otherwiſe than brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hold their Concluſion, and ſtick to their invet era<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And unneceſſary diviſion themſelves call, what is not for to avoid Idolatrous practiſes, or Heretical errours; and yet in their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for themſelves alledge none but frivolous inſtances tending, as they judge, to Superſtition, wherein they prove themſelves much more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, by ſuch religious oppoſition as they make againſt them; and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning their beſt Conſciences, than they poſſibly can be, who for order ſake, ſolemneſs of worſhip, and conformity to the ancient Cuſtoms of Chriſts Church, and to avoid offence unto other Churches ſticking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably unto them, retain rather than invent ſuch adjuncts to Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to ſearch out any new Topick from whence to draw out rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt this hainous ſin of Schiſmatizing, wherein I am not prevented by them diſputing upon the falſe ſuppoſitions, that they at any time were a Church: and if they had been, that they who oppoſed them could be ſaid to Divide Schiſmatically from them, of whoſe communion they never were, nor ever were obliged to be. They are therefore with others to conſider, How ſolemn and ſevere a command of Chriſt they ſlight and contemn, who divide from a Church without more weighty exceptions than hitherto, have been offered by them, or heard by us. For paſſing by that which we now believe they could wiſh themſelves unſaid, and are well content to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, <hi>Antichriſtianiſm, Popery, Baaliſm, Idolatry,</hi> and what not of moſt foul, bitter, and falſe ſlanders and reproaches unbecoming the mouth of any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſtian (with which notwithſtanding they thriv'd ſo exceedingly at firſt into Power and eſtimation) there remains nothing now but ſuch ſtarv'd allegations and pittiful exceptions as may call in queſtion their diſcretion, as well as conſcience, to urge them.

ſo divide a man from the Body: How can a man that is a Schiſmatick be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Will they ſay by being of the Myſtical Body of Chriſt, though not Viſible? In this excuſe they fall into many dangerous abſurdities: Firſt, in conceiving of Chriſts Viſible Church as not the Myſtical Body of Chriſt. For it is called Myſtical not becauſe it is internal and inviſible, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a Natural, but a Spiritual Body: It is not a Political, as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſignifies <hi>Civil or Humane Society,</hi> but a Divine Body. It is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſterd ſo much by Lawes of humane and common Invention as Spiritual. Secondly, In that it is ſuppoſed here, what we have before diſproved that they are two diſtinct Bodies, <hi>the Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Myſtical,</hi> as they ſpeak, from the Viſible: So that a man may be of the one and not of the other: which cannot be underſtood: For though a man may not be Viſibly of the outward Church, yet he muſt be and may be of the Viſible Church. They are not Viſibly of the Viſible Church; who by far diſtance of Place and time are involuntarily ſeparated from the Communion of the Church: but they who live within the communion of the Church and uncharitably divide from its communion are not of the Viſible Church at all; nor yet, for ought can be made appear, of that they call Inviſible, any more than an Heretick: For as the ſame St, <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>Neither the Heretick pertains to the</hi>

The Firſt of theſe is in part very ridiculous, as we have ſhewed, and in part very falſe: Ridiculous it is, becauſe it implies as much as to ſay, Give us but our demands and then we will be quiet: by which Rule no man ſhould defend his own right in leſſer matters, which to part with, perhaps would not utterly undo him; but he muſt be lookt on as acceſſary to, and guilty of his own deſtruction, if the Invader ſhall have power enough to bring it upon him, becauſe he will not peaceably ſatisfie his unjuſt deſires. A man may be (and our Saviour in the Goſpel ſaith expreſly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 10. is,) unjuſt in the leaſt, as well as in much. And ſo undoubtedly are they, who, having no Autority but what they frame to themſelves, ſhall by violence and aggreſſions attempt to extort the leaſt thing belonging of right to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, though haply better ſpar'd than kept; For it is a Caſe of Juſtice, rather than Chriſtianity. In juſtice and common equity, the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our members of a Church and ſtate, owe obedience to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, in all things not contrary to the Law of God, the Church, or the Nation: but at moſt, they can claim ſuch things that are (as they ſay) indifferent to be granted them, out of Courteſie or Charity only. And whoever was ſo wilfully ſtupid as not to perceive that Injuſtice, is much more a ſin than Uncharitableneſs; and ſo, whatever miſchief or guilt ſhall fall out in ſuch contentions, muſt neceſſarily light upon the heads of the unjuſt Aggreſſour, and not indiſcreet Reſiſter, were it indiſcretion to withſtand, to deny ſuch bold and inſolent demanders; or uncharitableneſs: both which are denied in the preſent Caſe. For there can be nothing more unjuſt on the one ſide, and unwiſe on the other, than ſo rudely and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to require of another all that may be granted; or to grant all ſuch things as are ſo demanded. And if they urge ſtill <hi>The peace of the Church to require ſuch conceſſions:</hi> I ſhall anſwer, Let them firſt (as all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to do) obſerve the Peace of Nature, and the Peace of Nations, which is not to offer violence, nor to be unjuſt, nor to go out of their Rank and Order, but with good Autority, and then take care for the Peace of the Church. But what can be more abſurd, than that men ſhould break the Peace of Nations and Nature it ſelf, yea the Law of God and Scriptures, which require to obey all that are in autority over us, as well Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally as Civilly, and then ſo much as to mention the Peace of the Church? eſpecially calling that only the Peace of the Church which puts them into quiet poſſeſſion of their deſires. But to this we add, that it is alſo very falſe which is here ſuppoſed to be true. For there is nothing more manifeſt than that with diverſe things of indifferent nature they mix many things of indiſpenſable uſe to a Church: and ſuch is that ſo much reproached and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided Hierarchie; which all the earth ſees they have made it their buſineſs to Deſtroy utterly. And when we plainly ſee, as we do, that thoſe things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent are demanded chiefly as an introduction to a farther aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things we hold neceſſary, we hold them no longer indifferent; nor can we in common prudence or Chriſtianity part with them to ſuch perſon; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than we can in a neighbourly manner lend away an Ax or Hammer, when we are aſſured, they will be made uſe of to break open our houſes and ſpoil us, though we know they may poſſibly be made uſe of to other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                        <pb n="241" facs="tcp:55232:141"/>The Second Obſtacle, rather than Objection caſt in our way is the parity of their Caſe with the Church of England, with that of the Church of England with the Roman: wherein whether they ſhow more Spite or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, may be a queſtion: Their Policy imitates them, who finding the war to lie heavy upon them at their own doors, contrive by all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to tranſlate it into another Country: as was particularly ſeen in <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſons</hi> Letter to his late Sacred Majeſty, who finding the ability of his pen and weight of his diſcourſes, adviſed him rather to turn himſelf againſt the common enemy, the Papiſt: And thus theſe men would needs oblige us to make our quarrel good againſt the Romaniſts, that they may be the leſ, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted in the purſuance of their moſt Schiſmatical deſigns againſt the Church in which they were educated. And this being diſcovered, we might well excuſe ourſelves from ſuch a task as they would ſet us. But this we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved in good part: and had we not, might, and ſhall in a very few words diſpatch, as ſomewhat out of its proper place. We grant then, there is a Schiſm between us and the Romaniſts. And we grant that there can be no cauſe to be Schiſmaticks, though for a Separation there may: and that they are truly Schiſmaticks who have miniſtred juſt Cauſe of Separation. Some we know, out of an ancient Father, have urged againſt us, That there can be no cauſe to divide the Church: which is true in two ſenſes only: Firſt, when that Church is not before really divided from other Churches of unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd integrity; <hi>Realy</hi> I ſay, by deſerting ſome conſiderable point of Faith, or introducing ſome unchriſtian manner of worſhip, though not <hi>Openly</hi> and <hi>Formally,</hi> as hath been ſaid. Again, it is true only in ſuch junctures as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake thoſe words in, which was an apt and orthodox agreement within itſelf, both in Faith and manners: in ſuch Caſes there can be no cauſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Church, as did the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But it was never his purpoſe to ſay that no caſe could happen in which it was not lawful for one Church to leave the Communion of another; when it was ſo often done. So ſtill the point is wholly, whether cauſe was given or not, and not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch outward, and wilful Separation was made. For undoubtedly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome would mince the matter, Separate we did, and that wilfully from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and choſe, rather than were forced to go out. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe very grounds we ſtill ſtand out and refuſe to return, The groſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions there maintained and not lurking: and the fear of the loſs of our ſouls in there continuing, and much more thither returning. What thoſe are, hath been even now touched; and we here add, that notwithſtanding 'tis confeſſed ſuch ſenſes are found of their doctrine and ſuperſtitious worſhip in ſome private authors amongſt them, which they offer at firſt to them they would ſeduce, which may put perſons into a poſſibility of their continuing, without incurring damnation; yet the Publick autority of that Church (which I ſuppoſe they will call their Church) having evermore of late years, cenſur'd, purged, and expunged ſuch more tollerable conſtructions; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the moſt harſh, and uncatholick, there can be no great regard had to the fairer opinions. Again, it is not ſufficient that a Church hath a true ſenſe of Chriſtian Faith, if it alloweth and commendeth a falſe and a wicked ſenſe. 'Tis little to the purpoſe, or to their advantage, to ſay (for inſtance ſake) as the more ſober, eſpecially when they would gain upon the good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of men, That Images may be worſhipped relatively and as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to devotion and helps, but when there are found, and generally known to be ſuch doctrines as teach a veneration of Images for their own ſakes, and directly, and that with the ſame ſort of worſhip that the things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55232:142"/>
are capable of; (though perhaps they upon a pinch can inſert a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which neither can be underſtood nor profit) ſuch a doctrine as this known to be delivered by the Principal Doctors of their Churches and maintain'd, not being condemned by that Church (however not generally embraced) may ſubject a Church to a cenſure of Hereſie and Idolatry of both: and ſo in other things, whereof tolerable ſenſes are given in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or elſe they could not be ſaid ſo much as to be a Church at all; but intolerable and Heretical are alſo uncondemned, and ſo are no true Church: and ſo may be ſeparated from, without Schiſm, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peril of damnation united to.

                     <p>Thus we ſee how the caſes in the matter difier. And no leſs may we ſee the difference in the manner. For 'tis apparent that Schiſmaticks againſt the Church of England never had any Legal autority to warrant their vile and Scandalous practices: but were forced to give names to things uncapable of them, to excuſe themſelves; or elſe by an unnatural courſe to entitle the People to a Power Supream, who have none at all, but what is given them from another fountain: neither did the people concurr with ſuch miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaners, as was pretended they did. But thirdly, another difference is to be noted from the Rights of a Patriarchal Power over a Provincial Church, not properly of its Dioceſs, and that of a Metropolitan with his Suffragans over the members of the Church which they altogether make. For, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtitutions of the Church, though a Patriarchs Power was <hi>Intenſively</hi> equal to Epiſcopal, over his proper and immediate Dioceſs, and <hi>Extenſively</hi> much greater than the Metropolitans or Biſhops in relation to other Dioceſſes: yet was it never ſo Intenſive <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo particular and great in thoſe Biſhops Dioceſſes over which he had only an Order of Unity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Intrinſick power to diſpoſe matters therein, though in proceſs of time this alſo was invaded much by him, and might be recovered to the proper Biſhop by the Laws of the Church. But the Biſhops of this Church had the ſole and immediate diſpoſing of the affairs of it, and nothing could be concluded without obligation of obedience out of Conſcience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Concurrence, as deſparately as Schiſmaticks then did and ſtill do rage at this truth. But then, as <hi>Hinderſon</hi> ſaith with others, <hi>They would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reform themſelves.</hi> It is very likely ſo, meaning, as they would have them; but that, not to the better Rule of the Ancient Churches, and the Scriptures, is more than they knew, or would acknowledg when they ſaw; becauſe ſtill they would have done otherwiſe, and invented a new Rule of their own.</p>

So that although it ſhould be doubtful as moſt things are managed by Learned Partiſans) whether, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the grounds of Separation in themſelves, the Separation be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, or lawful and laudable; yet by ſuch an outward Characteriſtick, it might be competently diſcerned. And ſo farmuſt I needs comply with that Judicious and Holy Father, and ſuch as urge this out of him againſt us, as to yield it a moſt probable outward Note of Schiſm, for any man, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, not a Church, but in <hi>Fieri</hi> (as they ſpeak) only, and in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to divide from the Univerſal Church: not only as comprehending all Ages, but of any one Age: the weight and evidence of which Conceſſion will appear from the eſteem of the Church Catholick, and the wrath and extent of Chriſts promiſes to preſerve it in All truth. For this is certain, That Chriſt directed his promiſes and reſtrained them to no one time or Age. And it is not probable there ſhould be ſuch an Interceſſion or intermiſſion of Faith or Chriſtianity, that the univerſal Church ſhould mortally err in any one thing neceſſary to ſalvation; nay, though we take it not in ſuch a large ſenſe as ſometimes it is wont to be uſed, for all individual perſons in it, as well as Churches of which the whole is conſtituted. And therefore to deſert the communion of all Churches, not of perſons (for this is ſcarce to be ſuppoſed to happen at any time) doth argue ſhrewdly, That the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath much of Schiſm in it; without examination of particular grounds which are pretended ſufficient. For it will be ſaid That it ought not to be ſuppoſed that Chriſt ſhould deliver over his whole Church to ſuch hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal errours, which only can exempt a Separation from Schiſm. From ſuch notorious ſuſpicions as theſe we may clear our ſelves thus. Firſt, by putting a difference between the Church ſo united as is here ſuppoſed to rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate it the <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Univerſal</hi> Church, and the Church diſunited and divided long before any Reformation came to be ſo much as called for in theſe weſtern Parts, with attempts to put ſuch deſires into practice. The diviſion or Schiſm between the Weſtern and Eaſtern Churches happened about the years 860 and 870, under <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second, Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Where the guilt was, is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject.

Had therefore Reformers ſo divided from the Catholick Church united, as did the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> it were more than probable that their diviſion might from thence be known to be Schiſm without any more ado: but it is certain it was quite otherwiſe. And therefore ſome other Conviction muſt be expected, beſides that Characteriſtick.</p>

The Infallibility of any one Eminent Church, which like a City on a Mountain, a Beacon on a Hill, a Pharus or Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower to ſuch as are like to ſhipwrack their Faith, may certainly direct them to a ſafe Station and Haven? And all this to be the Church or See of <hi>Rome?</hi> But alas, though this were as deſirable as admirable, yet we have nothing to induce us to receive it for ſuch, but certain prudent inferences that ſuch there is, becauſe ſuch there ought to be for the aſcertaining dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds in the truth; and therefore ſo (ſay they) actually it is: and leſt humane reaſon ſhould ſeem too malapert to teach what divine Autority ought to do, therefore muſt the Scripture be canvaſ'd and brought againſt the beſt Preſidents in Antiquity, to the Contrary; to Patronize ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Dogms. The matter then returns to what we at firſt propounded: <hi>viz.</hi> the Judging of Schiſm from the Cauſes, and of the Cauſes, from the Scriptures, and the more Genuine and ancient Traditions of Chriſts Church, before ſuch Schiſm diſtracted the ſame. Theſe two things therefore we leave to be made Good by Romaniſts, in which they are very defective: Firſt, that there is any One Notorious infallible Judge actually conſtituted, whereby we may certainly diſcern the Schiſmaticalneſs, or Hereticalneſs of any one Church varying from the truth: and this becauſe, It were to be wiſh'd a Judg were ſomewhere extant. Secondly, that what ever Security or Safety of Communion is to be found in the Viſible Church, properly and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly belongs to the Roman Church; becauſe ſome of the Ancients tell, the time when it did not actually err. But if our proofs be much more ſtrong and apparent, which declare that actually it doth err, and wherein it doth err, what an empty and bootleſs preſumption muſt it needs be, to invite to its communion upon her immunity from Erring? or to condemn men of Schiſm for this only, That they communicate not with it? which is the bold method of Roman Champions.</p>

And if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Nature Individual of God to be made up of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of things, and naturesas the Body of man, then did we not pitch upon the true Notion of God: which we muſt alwayes ſuppoſe to be moſt perfect: But we have more than conjectural knowledge that ſome things in the world are not compounded, at leaſt as we are; but of a more pure and ſimple ſubſtance: ſuch as we call Spirit. And we ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55232:144"/>
ſtill there is a poſſibility of a more tranſcendent purity of ſubſiſting than they are of, until we come to the moſt abſolute, pure, and perfect <hi>Being,</hi> than which nothing can be, or conceived to be more Pure, and Perfect: and that muſt of neceſſity be God. Again, ſuch a compoſition would deſtroy the nature of God, becauſe ſuch it muſt be that nothing either in act or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, can poſſibly precede it: but where there are diſtinct parts, or humors concurring to make one Entire thing, there a real priority at leaſt of nature, muſt needs be: becauſe it cannot be ſuppoſed but the Cauſe muſt in ſome manner go before the Effect, and ſuch ſuppoſed compoſitions have of the nature of a material Cauſe to ſuch a thing, as they ſo conſtitute. Thirdly, all things of a differing nature concurring to make <hi>One,</hi> cannot move themſelves, nor of themſelves meet with ſuch concord as to make one thing without the power and wiſdome of ſome third Superiour Agent brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them ſo together. So that to ſuppoſe ſuch a God, is to ſuppoſe one Above, and before him; who ſhould Effect all this which is repugnant to the nature of God. Laſtly, nothing can be ſo well ſet together but it may be ſuppoſed to be undone and diſſolved again, either by the nature of things themſelves tending to ſeparation, or by the ſame power, or, if they will, fortune (as ſome have called it) which brought them together.</p>
                     <p>This is yet further confirmed unto us from the Holy Scriptures: which were beſt able to reveal the nature of God unto us ſo far as was expedient, or perhaps, for us in this life, poſſible to underſtand: where God moſt admirably deſcribeth himſelf thus, <hi>I am that I am:</hi> which is his name for<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14, 15.</note> ever, which no created thing can claim to it. The like to which is that name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whereby he calls himſelf, ſignifying an abſolute eſſential Being. For nothing beſides God can define God. Every thing but he, is defined by another thing, which differs in ſome manner from it: but God is defined by himſelf, becauſe nothing can be Higher than he, and nothing in him is really diſtinct from him, as in other things.

And for more clear and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual proceeding herein, it will be requiſite firſt to explain ſuch terms as this Doctrine much depends on, as Eſſence, Subſtance, Nature, Perſon and Trinity it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eſſence</hi> is of ſomewhat larger extent than <hi>Subſtance,</hi> becauſe <hi>Subſtance</hi> ſignifies properly only that which is oppoſite to Accident, or that which adheres or inheres to Subſtance: but <hi>Eſſence</hi> ſignifies all kinds of Beings, as well of Accidents, as Subſtances. Nature is the reſtraint of Eſſence and Subſtance both, in their general Being, to ſome more ſpecial kind of thing; as there is the Nature of Man, and the Nature of Beaſt, the Nature of Accidents, and the Nature of Subſtances, the Nature of Colours, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55232:146"/>
the Nature of Quantities: ſo that Nature is not that whereby a thing ſimply and abſolutely is, but whereby it is what it is. Hence we ſay alſo, the Nature of God or the Creator, and the Nature of the Creature; Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by which, as is ſaid, a thing is what it is, and diſtinct from others. And as for the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> it is true what hath been objected by ſome of old, that it is not in terms t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> be found in Scripture; for the word doth not import any one or more things abſolutely, but rather the manner of ſuch things being, the better to ſettle the mind in the apprehenſion of that great Myſtery. Now the Holy Scriptures doth very often only propound the Article of Faith to be believed by us, but leaves the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and conceiving the ſame to the holy prudence of Men, whom he hath for the inſtruction of inferior perſons ordained in his Church, which have agreed ſo to term that three-fold perſonal Relation, in the Deity. A <hi>Perſon</hi> is defined to be an entire and abſolute Being, of reaſonable nature. Man in general is not a Perſon, becauſe he ſubſiſteth not by himſelf. A Beaſt in particular is not a Perſon, becauſe void of knowledge and reaſon. The ſoul of Man, though endowed with reaſon, is not a Perſon, becauſe not of it ſelf entire and perfect, being part of another thing, <hi>i e.</hi> Man. But <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are Perſons, becauſe ſingle Subſtances, abſolute in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and rational.</p>
                     <p>To collect therefore, and conclude from what is thus briefly premiſed, we ſay, that theſe Notions of <hi>Eſſence, Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken more ſtrictly and properly; according to which we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hold it as a moſt fundamental Truth in Chriſtian Religion, as it is in the Religion of all civilized People, that God is but one in Eſſence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Being and Nature of God, as God, are but one. But if we take the ſaid Notions more largely, for that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the manner of Being, as well as Being it ſelf, then may we ſpeak of the nature of a Perſon; as when we ſay, that the nature of a Perſon is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the nature of things ſimply taken. And if Nature be taken, as ſometimes, for the condition of a thing or Perſon, we may truly ſay, that in the Trinity, the Three Perſons, as Perſons, are of a different nature, though they differ not in the nature of the Deity: For, that they really, and not imaginarily, or by mans fancy and conception different from one another, is a received Truth by all, reputed true Believers; but nothing can be diſtinct from another, but by ſomewhat peculiar to it, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is peculiar to a thing, and <hi>ingredient</hi> into its Being, may be, and is commonly called the nature of it; in which ſenſe we may ſay, Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are of a different nature, becauſe the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt Father or Son; for the nature of the Father, as Father, is to beget; the nature of the Son, as Son, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; the nature of the Holy Ghoſt, as Holy Ghoſt, to proceed. But all this hindereth not in the Nature of God they ſhould be one and the ſame, and ſo but one diſtinct God; and this makes the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity: For were not the Perſons diſtinct by ſomewhat real, and not ſo notional as to be fictitious, there could not be ſaid to be a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity or Trinity of Perſons. And again, if in nature they were not the ſame, there could be no Identity worthy of that Myſtery: For other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures differing one from another in ſubſiſting diſtinctly, agree in the unity of a general nature, as three men agree in the common nature of man. But 'tis otherwiſe in the ſacred Myſtery of the Perſons and Nature of God; for the Nature of God is numerically the ſame, and yet is without inequality or
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55232:146"/>
diviſion, communicated totally and entirely to every Perſon. Again, other Perſons are of a diſtinct ſubſiſtence, that is, ſubſiſt apart; but the<note place="margin">

                     <p>From the Point thus briefly opened and ſtated, theſe four things are to be aſſerted and believed: Firſt, That God is but one in Nature. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That there is a three-fold Perſonality in that Divine Nature. Thirdly, That theſe three are diſtinct, and how. Fourthly, That they are the ſame in ſubſiſting. Of the firſt it hath in the beginning been ſufficiently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and may well here be taken for granted. The ſecond is now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and that in theſe following Enquiries: Firſt, By the Grounds of Natural Reaſon. Secondly, The Grounds of the Old Teſtament for the ſame. Thirdly, The Opinion of the Church of the Jews concerning the Trinity. Fourthly, The Grounds of the Goſpel founding this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the firſt is called in queſtion, is becauſe God is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed both by the Hiſtories of all Ages and People, to be known to the Gentiles naturally, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a connatural Inſtinct; and that many of them did worſhip the true God, according to that Law and State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in which they lived. But if God eſſentially and immutably conſiſts of three Perſons in one Nature Divine, they that worſhipped God otherwiſe than in the Holy Trinity, worſhipped him not as he is, and they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him not as he is, worſhip a falſe God, and they that worſhip a falſe God, worſhip an Idol. And hence it is that divers learned men have ſaid, They who worſhip God out of the Trinity, worſhip an Idol, and not the true God; which ſevere Argument concludes as well againſt the Jews, as Gentiles; if, as ſome believe, they underſtood not God in the Trinity, but worſhipped him in the ſimplicity of a Deity only according to the way of Nature. But if this only men were taught by nature, (for that men were by a light of nature led to worſhip not only God, but one God, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Scriptures inform us) that they ſhould worſhip a God, and him alone, and did not intimate withal ſo much of the true Nature of God, as was abſolutely neceſſary to be known, to the worſhipping the true; what benefit could it be to man, to have ſuch an imperfect knowledge of him, whenas ſtill he muſt worſhip an Idol, God being the ſame under the Law of Nature, as he is under the Goſpel of Grace? For as that man who acknowledgeth but one God, ſhould commit Idolatry, who ſhould ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine and firmly perſwade himſelf that God was of the faſhion and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m of Man, and worſhip him as ſuch a one, ſitting in a fair and glorious room in Heaven: So no leſs in reaſon doth it ſeem, that he ſhould in like manner offend, who doth believe no diſtinction of the Deity into the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Perſons, but acknowledges but one Perſon in the Divine Nature. The reaſon of both is, becauſe he worſhips him neither way as he is, and that not in relative Attributes in order to us, but abſolute, eſſential manner of Being. Now no man that thinks of another otherwiſe than he is in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, thinks really of that, but ſome other thing.</p>
                     <p>To vindicate then both Jew and Gentile from ſuch groſs error, even in the Object of Worſhip, and not only them, but Nature it ſelf from miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them; it is ſaid, that the Gentile had ſome light apprehenſion of the Deity under this notion: And that firſt from Tradition of the moſt ancient Patriarchs, who undoubtedly were ſufficiently inſtructed in that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55232:147"/>
Deity. And that this Tradition was ſo conveyed to the ears of ſome prime Philoſophers, or expoſed to their view in the monuments of ancient dayes, that they have committed the ſame to writing, as divers of their Books ſtill extant intimate unto us, though obſcurely. Secondly, The many footſteps of this great Myſtery found in the courſe of Nature, do (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to many wiſe men) ſuggeſt to an attentive mind the Nature of God, as now received, which others have at large purſued; imitating herein St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book of the Trinity, wherein he endeavoureth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib. 10. &amp;</hi> 11.</note> the manner of this Myſtery from the internal ſenſes of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will and Memory; and external, of Apprehenſion, Imagination and common Senſation, all which agree in one, and proceed from one. But in this method no ſure footing can be found, for more ſerious and ſolid certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a man, though we ſhould yield ſome glimpſes of that divine light to ſhine from thence; for the Book of the Creature wherein God is to be read, doth not deliver all things equally clear to us: But firſt, having plainly made known the thing it ſelf, leaves us to ſeek from what we know imperfectly of God, to procure by due worſhip and Petition a farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into that myſtery, which being in ſome meaſure better inſtructed in from above, things below may confirm us in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It ſeems to me that naturally (not taking Nature ſtrictly for a neceſſary and full aſſurance, but tacit, at leaſt, intimation) there is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat of the Trinity of Perſons, from the too common error of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging more Gods than one. For (as we have ſaid) it being a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Nature no leſs apparent that God is one, than that he is ſimply, it could ſcarce become ſo general an error, that men ſhould contrary to ſuch natural light, worſhip a plurality or variety of Gods, but that there was ſomewhat received together with that Principle, which might incline and expoſe them to error; and that was a general Notion, whether by Tradition or Nature, that the Divine Nature was diverſified: But how this could conſiſt with the other Principle, not being capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they eaſily fell from their firſt, and more ſound Notion of the Unity of the Divine Nature, and took up the opinion of many Gods diſtinct, as well in Nature it ſelf, as Perſons. And do we wonder that they ſhould forſake the trueſt notion of a Deity in this abſtruſeneſs, when in thoſe things that are confeſſedly clear to ordinary Reaſons by nature, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated to a little leſs than brutiſh ſtupidity, being, as the Scriptures tell us, of ſome <hi>things willingly ignorant.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But it were much more abſurd, that the peculiar people of God, the Jews, ſhould be ignorant of this ſo neceſſary a Point; and yet we find that now-ada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s they declare againſt it expreſly, denying withal this to have been any branch of the Faith profeſſed by their Progenitors. But we need not be very anxious about their Authority now adayes, it being moſt eaſie to be made apparent, in how many and great things they have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in their Doctrine and Worſhip, ſince it pleaſed God to withdraw his holy Spirit from that Church, upon their rejecting of the true Meſſias ſent them, and to tranſlate it to the Church of the Gentiles. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they who obſerve not that now, ſhould argue againſt it, as a thing not to be done; and moreover deny that ever it was believed or practiſed by their Forefathers, for there remains no other way to excuſe themſelves in their preſent error, but to maintain that it was never otherwiſe held. This is a common evaſion of all Hereticks and Sectaries: But that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the Old Teſtament contained this Doctrine in ſubſtance, though
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55232:147"/>
the more perſpicuous and glorious manifeſtation of the ſame was reſerved for the New, is not to be denied; eſpecially if we conſider how that many of their own Doctors and Rabbies have ſo interpreted the ſame. And ſome have admired the Hebrew Language as the holy Tongue, not ſo much (as ſome of moderner ſtanding amongſt them have given out) becauſe of the neat and modeſt expreſſion of things of impure and obſcene nature; for it is very plain, that the moſt obſcene things are there as broadly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed as elſewhere, but from the matter which it treats of generally, very divine; and particularly from the nature of that Tongue, in every word of which being a Radix or original, the Myſtery of the Trinity is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in that it conſiſts but of three principal Letters, which Letters make but one word. But there are more ſure words of Propheſie than they, and ſuch are theſe, together with the Comment and approbation of the Chaldee Paraphraſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. v. 8. it is ſaid, <hi>They heard the voice of the</hi>

And again, <hi>v.</hi> 22. where the Hebrew hath, <hi>And the Lord God ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jonathans,</hi> or as ſome more properly, the Hieruſalem Targum hath, <hi>The Word of the Lord ſaid.</hi> And the ſame Hieruſalem Targum on <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 33. 7. hath, <hi>The Word of the voice of the Lord heard Judah,</hi> where the Original and other Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have, <hi>Hear Lord, or receive Lord, the voice of Judah.</hi> And ſo in other places; which doth argue a Perſonality aſcribed unto the Word of God: Which doth farther appear, for that the action of Creation, extending the Heavens, and Repenting, is attributed unto the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>But I leave the aſſerting of the Myſtery of the Trinity from the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, interpreted by the learnedſt and moſt renowned of the Jewiſh Doctors, to ſuch who have made it their deſign to convince them from teſtimonies of their own Authors, as <hi>Petrus Galatinus,</hi> and more exactly, <hi>Joſephus de Voiſin,</hi> in his Comments on <hi>Prigro Chriſtianae Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi> and eſpecially, <hi>de Trinitate.</hi> I ſhall only add here that memorable paſſage in <hi>Bibliander,</hi> out of the Jewiſh Rabbies, upon that place in<note place="margin">Bibliander de Paſchate Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. <hi>Gen. 28. 11.</hi>

1. 26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6 3, &amp;c. Concerning all which it is to be obſerved; Firſt, That it is not to be expected the teſtimonies of the Old Teſtament, whoſe deſign it was to deliver all things more covertly and obſcurely, ſhould be altogether ſo <hi>literally</hi> and <hi>expreſly</hi> taken, as that none other may be found as proper as that ſence given by Chriſtians; but it may ſuffice, that an apt accommodation may be made to the confirmation of our Faith, and that by the chief enemies to it. Secondly, That the Tradition of the Jewiſh Church differed from the hiſtorical or literal ſence. Hence our Saviour Chriſt proves the Meſſias to be God, out of <hi>Pſalm 110. v. 1. The Lord ſaid</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. Matth. 22. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>unto,</hi> &amp;c. arguing to this effect, He who was greater than <hi>David</hi> himſelf, from whom the Meſſias ſhould come, muſt needs be God, <hi>David</hi> calling him, in Spirit, <hi>Lord;</hi> but <hi>David,</hi> in Spirit, calls the Meſſias <hi>his Lord,</hi> whereas <hi>David</hi> being himſelf abſolute Soveraign, had no mortal greater than he, therefore he muſt be God. This was then generally received amongſt the wiſeſt of them, That the Meſſias was there intended, though the words might be capable of a more literal ſence. And the like may we judge of the Arguments of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> drawn out of the Old Teſtament, to confirm the Doctrine of the New, and particularly this; for it is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he bringeth many proofs, as do alſo the other ſacred Pen-men out of the Books of the Old Teſtament, which have a literal ſence much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that purpoſe to which they are alledged. But it is certain that the ancient Jews did maintain two ſences, a <hi>Literal,</hi> and a <hi>Myſtical;</hi> and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> being educated in the prime Traditions and Myſteries of their Divinity, uſed them according to the known ſence of the learned: For otherwiſe it had been as eaſie then for the Jews to have put in their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt his Doctrine, as now it is for Jews to cavil at them.</p>

                     <p>The third Perſon in the holy Trinity is the holy Ghoſt, which we have ſhewed in part, that the learnedeſt of the ancient Jews were not ignorant of, though more obſcurely delivered in the Old Teſtament than in the New. The firſt thing then we are to prove is, That the holy Ghoſt is a Perſon; for that it is, there needs no other proof than the words themſelves ſo often uſed in Scripture: And that it ſubſiſts perſonally, and not only as an Act or Grace, will appear from theſe two general heads, The Acts of it, an the Attributes given to it. And firſt, In what ſenſe the Scriptures uſe evil Spirit, in the ſame ſenſe may it be ſaid to uſe the good Spirit; but evil Spirit is frequently uſed for a Perſon, who is the author of miſchief to mankind, and therefore the good Spirit muſt be a Perſon, the author of<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 6. Rom. 11. 8. Eph. 2. 2. 1 Sam. 16. 14. 2 Chron. 18. 20, 21.</note> good to man. We read in Scripture of a <hi>Spirit of error,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of ſlumber,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of diſobedience,</hi> and of an <hi>evil Spirit</hi> that poſſeſſed <hi>Saul,</hi> and of a <hi>lying Spirit</hi> that entred into, and moved the falſe Prophets; and in the New Teſtament as well as humane Authors, of divers who have been infeſted with evil Spirits. Now all theſe were real and perſonal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences, and therefore in parity of reaſon ſo ſhould the good Spirit, of which we ſo often read both in the Old and New Teſtament, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of the Spirit of the Lord; as the Spirit of the Lord moved upon the waters at the beginning, and the Spirit of the Lord fell upon ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And if it be here replyed, That we are to underſtand the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits after the ſame manner we underſtand the evil; and that the evil Spirits being evil Angels, the good Spirit ſhould be good Angels only: We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, not denying, That Spirit may be ſo uſed in Scripture divers times; and that by the ſame parity of reaſon that it is inſinuated unto us, that the evil Spirit hath one Prince and chief amongſt them called <hi>Lucifer,</hi> ſo the good Spirits have one ſupreme over them, that good Spirit of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That where Scripture ſpeaks of Spirit abſolutely, there the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit is conſtantly to be underſtood, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Again, We read from the Acts of the Spirit as interceding for us, being<note place="margin">Rom 8. 26. Eph. 4. 30. Mat. 3. 16.</note> grieved; and deſcending upon Chriſt in a bodily ſhape at his Baptiſm; and Chriſts ſpeech to his Diſciples, ſaying in St. <hi>John, I will ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55232:149"/>
and he ſhall give you another Comforter.</hi> Chriſt was the one Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not only by his Graces, but perſonal preſence among his Diſciples; and anſwerable to this, muſt the holy Spirit be alſo, here promiſed.</p>
                     <p>And that this divine Perſon is diſtinct from the other, appeareth from the general Doctrine of the Trinity above, and ſpecially out of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> where Chriſt ſaith,—<hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> which muſt imply a diſtinction. And St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>He that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto</hi>

                        <hi>me, Upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joh. 14. 16. Joh.</hi> 15. 26.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame place of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> appeareth the equality of all theſe three Perſons; and eſpecially from the immediate operation the Spirit had upon Chriſt, who was God and Man; for of it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> thus propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.</note>

                     </p>

And by St. <hi>Peter</hi> it is called, <hi>The Spirit of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

                     <p>And thus we ſee confirm'd, what St. <hi>John</hi> very plainly and poſitively<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7.</note> aſſerteth of this Myſtery, That <hi>there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>theſe three are one.</hi> And this may ſuffice to have ſpoken (according to our purpoſe) compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as well of the Unity as Trinity of theſe Perſons in the God-head; only adding, without any long or curious enquiry, the ſeveral <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Idioms,</hi> whereby they are diſtinct in our Faith. The Property of the firſt Perſon is to be the Fountain, and after the manner of firſt Principle of the other, to whom therefore ſome aſcribe a dignity of order, above the other two, though not of time or duration, being all co-eternal, and the one not to be conceived anterior to the other: Nor of Nature, as if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature were unequally communicated to them, but that they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal in Being and in Power, or Acting externally. Another Property of the firſt Perſon is to be a Father in reſpect of the Son, the ſecond Perſon; and together with the Son, to bear ſuch a relation to the third, the holy Spirit, for which no proper name hath been yet found out, and whether it be poſſible to expreſs the ſame aptly in one word, I much queſtion.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THAT God is the proper Object of Chriſtian Faith or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not only as principal, but as all other things therein treated, relate to him, is before ſhewed. Now therefore we proceed from the Creator to the Creature, to which the two hands of God are more viſibly and eminently extended or ſtretched out: The firſt, In the <hi>Creation</hi> it ſelf; The other, In the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of God over the works of his hands, as the Scriptures phraſe is. And firſt, Of <hi>Creation;</hi> we underſtanding it to be after the nature of an Act, muſt find out the proper <hi>term</hi> or <hi>object</hi> of it, which is contained in that received definition thereof: <hi>Creation is the production of a thing out of nothing;</hi> or more plainly, <hi>a making ſomething of nothing.</hi> In which we are not ſo groſly to conceive of Gods Act, as if he made the world ſo of nothing, as a man makes a Statue of ſomething; but <hi>of</hi> nothing, or <hi>out</hi> of nothing, is as much as <hi>from</hi> nothing, or nothing concurring by way of pre-exiſtent matter, to produce ſuch an effect: For if any thing had been, which had not its firſt Being from the firſt Cauſe of all, God, that muſt have been God alſo, or there could not be ſaid to have been any God at all, becauſe there could be no order, where was no <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond;</hi> and where matter is ſuppoſed to have been eternal, there no priority of time can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: So that either ſuch thing muſt have been God, as we have ſeen in the Relations in the Trinity, or no God at all; becauſe that is not God, to which an equal in any reſpect, diſtinct in nature from him, may be found; for Gods Nature is to be above all.</p>
                     <p>Neither can any reaſon be poſſibly alledged, whereby it ſhould appear,

that, if ſimple matter (as ſome call it) might have ſubſiſted, before it was made ſimply by God, the Sun and Moon, and other compound bodies in Nature, might not have pre-exiſted and prevented Gods workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; or why an imperfect Being ſhould have the dignity denied to a more perfect, but at the pleaſure and will of the ſupream Agent diſpoſing all things?

                     <p>Furthermore, Unleſs there were a productive Power in God, of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of nothing, the Power of God would not anſwer the Nature of God. The Nature of God is infinite, ſo therefore muſt his Power be; but the Power of God could not be known to be infinite, if ſuch an infinite effect were not producible by him.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, This denial of Gods Power to produce even the firſt imaginable matter, would alſo deſtroy his Power in creating any thing not conſiſting of ſuch matter; and ſo ſhould the production of Spirits utterly be denied him, as having no pre-exiſtent matter, out of which they can be ſaid to be fram'd.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be conſeſſed, the word <hi>Create</hi> and <hi>Creation</hi> in Scripture, is not ſo ſtrictly uſed as in Philoſophers Books, but imports any notable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as well as that ſimple one without pre-exiſtence: Yet the thing it ſelf is affirmed; as where it is ſaid, <hi>All things were made by God;</hi> for there nothing is excepted or exempted from his Power; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note>

Now where there is no limitation upon an agent, but what proceeds from its own will, there nothing is impoſſible, and if it be poſſible for God to will (as muſt be, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man may deſire) to produce ſomewhat from nothing, it muſt be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to paſs what ſo is willed by him; otherwiſe God ſhould be diſappointed and fruſtrated in his intentions, than which nothing can be thought more abſurd, or repugnant to the Nature of God.</p>
                     <p>And thus at the ſame time it appears, as well what God made, as how, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is nothing extant, whether viſible or inviſible, but what was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him, and that abſolutely, as the Apoſtle more expreſly teſtifieth to the <hi>Coloſſians, By him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in</hi>

that all the Angels and ſeveral orders of thoſe inviſible Spirits in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, were the effect of his Power, no leſs than were inferior and viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And though there be no particular mention of the time, order, place, or manner of the Creation of Angels, yet that they were ſo created, general aſſurance we have from the Word of God; the holy Ghoſt adviſedly omitting (and mens wits only conjecturing at the) other things, to prevent pride and curioſity in man, to whom it was ſufficient to make a deſcription of thoſe things, which related to this viſible world, and concerned him to know: So that the Heavens themſelves, with the glorious and numerous Lights thereof, are no farther explained unto us, than as their influences concern the nature and actions of Man. It is a true Axiom, that all things were made for man, but it is not true, that they had no other end why God created them, namely, Heavens, heavenly Bodies, and heavenly Spirits, but for to ſerve the uſes of man, next to the ultimate end of all, his own Glory. For though it be ſaid of Angels, (and we take the word in the propereſt ſenſe, and not as it may be for the ſeveral Meſſengers and Diſpenſers of Gods will and Word, to the ſeveral Ages of men) <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits,</hi>

                     <p>Yet as no man can, out of Philoſophy or Scripture, determine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or number of Heavens, is it not to be peremptorily denied, that there are diſtinctions of places of Bliſs?

                     <p>It is true, we gather reaſonably from the poſition and motion of celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Lights, a diſtinction in diſtance and motion of them, and that a peculiar tract there is for moſt of them; but that this ſpace ſhould be roof'd over round with a pellucide, ſolid, aetherial ſubſtance, is an abſurd collection of Philoſophers, no ways favoured by Scripture, which, as it hath touched things of this nature with greater ſimplicity, ſo with much more probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; inviting us rather to an admiration of the divine Power, and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Providence, in ordaining ſo admirably thoſe bodies, as for his Glory, ſo for our inſtruction and edification in his ſervice.

Fire indeed is of a wonderful ſubtil nature, and operation moſt active, but whether any thing in ſubſtance, diſtinct from the other, and not only in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is ſcarce to be underſtood. And though Philoſophy buſies it ſelf to the loſing of its way, in the ſearch after theſe things, and preſumes to determine and impoſe upon others its uncertain Concluſions; yet the modeſty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion contents it ſelf to keep a mannerly diſtance, where God, by the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Nature, and much more of Theology, ſeems to ſay, <hi>Stand off;</hi> which we ſhall, contenting our ſelves at preſent, with that brief narration of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of the Creation of all things, found in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis:</hi> where we note, the way of Gods working to be moſt like himſelf, without any pains or trouble, but by the ſimple and abſolute word of his command given, <hi>Let there be Light.</hi>

For if they were ſo, then could there be no diſtinction or diſtance of time between one thing and another; but where there is ſuch a diverſity of time, there of neceſsity muſt be poſteriority and priority, and ſo no eternity.</p>

                        </gap>leſh inſtead thereof, of which rib he made the woman. And there is no ſuch difficulty as Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical wits would frame, when from hence they would infer, That, if God took one rib from <hi>Adam,</hi> he had either more at firſt than were natural to man, or fewer afterward, and ſo muſt have ſomething of monſtrouſneſs; a ſtrange argument to perſwade ſuch a man as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> That God did not this really, but that the Scripture here ſpeaks Metaphorically, when as this is a direct Hiſtory which is given us here of the Creation. For ſuppoſe we that God had made man at firſt otherwiſe than now he is by himſelf altered, might it not be well ſaid, that both the one and the other were natural to him? It is impoſſible that God ſhould do any thing monſtrous, or unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, through an whole ſpecies: and therefore no ſcruple ought to be made of allowing God, who is the Nature of Nature, to diſpoſe his works as he pleaſes, and change nature; ſo that if it ſhould ſeem good to him now to take away one of mans legs, and cauſe him generally to go upon one only, this would be no more monſtrons than his going now upon two is.</p>
                     <p>And in like manner, is it very frivolous, that is given as a reaſon by the Schools, of Gods cauſing ſuch a deep ſleep upon <hi>Adam,</hi> leſt he ſhould be ſenſible of too much pain, at that act of taking out his Rib; when as the ſame miracle that caſt him into a ſleep, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him from waking, under ſuch ſuppoſed pain, might as well have preſerved him from pain, waking, as ſleeping.

Why ſo? To the end he might thereby declare the Excellency of Man. For ſeeing, other Animals, and Beaſts being diſſolved by death their ſoul and Body periſh together, he ſpeaks of the production of them, as of thoſe things which were to periſh abſolutely. God therefore, about to faſhion man, takes his Body out of the earth, and then breaths in his Soul. Stay but a little, that I may ſhew to you the manner of this breathing into man, ſo far as I am able. For from what went before, and from hence he deſcribeth, as it were, the hope of Reſurrection. He makes the Body firſt: and Man firſt received a dead Image, and then the quickening vertue of the ſoul. He was firſt ſhown dead, then living. Firſt he made a dead Body, into which he was again to return: and thus when he had finiſhed that, he added the Character or form: and did not make his ſoul firſt, that he might not be a Spectatour of what was made. He would not ſuffer the ſoul to be preſent when he made man, leſt it ſhould glory as an aſſiſtant to God in that work: and not only that it might not boaſt, but might not ſo much as behold the manner how it was done. And thus doth God ſtill. For he frameth every one of us in the womb: But how he ſo frameth us, he hath granted no man to ſee. We are ſown, and we are faſhioned, nature perfecting the courſe, but the manner no man compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. O, the wonder! A Temple is made in a Temple; an Houſe in an Houſe is framed: and the outward houſe perceives it not. Firſt then, he makes man according to a dead Image: and then he ſaith, God breathed into the face of</hi> Adam <hi>the breath of Life, and man became a living ſoul. Some have been of opinion that this Breath was his very ſoul: and that it was given him of the very Eſſence of God: But that ſaying is not only very mild, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd alſo. For if the ſoul were the very ſubſtance of God; It could not be, that in this man it ſhould be wiſe, in another it ſhould be fooliſh, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and in this man a juſt ſoul, in that man an unjuſt. For the Eſſence of God is neither divided nor changed, but immutable—Nay, not only are the ſouls of men mutable, but liable to condemnation. For ſo ſaith the Goſpel,</hi>

                        <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, but cannot kill the ſoul, but fear ye him rather who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell. If therefore the ſoul be of God, then ſhould God condemn himſelf. Therefore it is neceſſary we ſhould ſee what this is. The Breathing. This breathing is the Power of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For as our Saviour breath'd on the faces of his Apoſtles, and ſaid, Receive</hi>

                        <hi>ye the Holy Ghoſt: ſo this divine breath heard after the manner of men, is that Venerable and Holy Spirit. And this Holy Spirit too preſent, was not the ſoul it ſelf, but made the ſoul: it was not it ſelf changed into the Soul, but fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. For the Holy Spirit was the Author: it was concerned in the making both of the body and Soul. For the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt made this work: And do not imagin that the Father contributed one part, the Son another, and the Holy Ghoſt a third. But this I ſay, that though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made it, it is the work of the Son, and the Fabrick of the Holy Spirit. &amp;c.</hi> Thus far that Elegant and Learned Author: However ſome inconſiderable difference is found amongſt ancient and Modern Doctours, ſome ſaying that

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l of man to be <hi>educated</hi> out of the matter of the Body, as are Brutes Souls. But that is not here nor there: becauſe certain it is that the way of producing the Soul at firſt differ'd much from what it doth in the courſe of Natural generation. For then were there no natural Cauſes concurring with God in the production of the Soul, but now there are; God now not ſo abſolutely creating humane ſouls, but that there ſhould be ſome pre-diſpoſing and preparatory acts on mans part conducing thereunto: For it ſeemeth not to be inconſiſtent with proper Creation, that ſuch Acts are required thereunto, ſo that the Soul of man is never now created, but by them preceding (according to the order of Nature, though not of time, becauſe in ſo concurring, the Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent doth not concurr with God in the very act of Creating, but to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion rather, which God hath by a Law made freely to himſelf decreed to work by in this matter: But at the firſt of all God purely made the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, and ſimply and ſolely acted of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>There are therefore theſe three errours to be avoided in the doctrine of the Soul: The firſt is that of Epicures and Infidels, that the Soul of man was no otherwiſe produced than the ſouls of Brutes: but that they are in Subſtance the ſame with brutes, differing only from them in the finer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the body; and the nobler aſpect which it informeth. But this cannot ſtand good: becauſe, though we grant that the evil diſpoſition of the humors of the Body, and incommodious frame of the Parts thereof, may impede the due exerciſe of ſuch Acts which are proper to that Kind, yet ſuch perfection cannot at all give ability to act ſo: and therefore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principle muſt be found out, whoſe nature it is ſo to act; and to which ſuch things are only Organical and ſubſervient. For, it being acknowledged that the Soul is of an Active, and more noble nature than the Body, as Spirit is than fleſh; it cannot be imagined that the Soul ſhould follow the faſhion or nature of the Body, but that the matter or the Body ſhould be accommodated and ſuited to the nature of the ſoul: as no man can ſay, that the hand ſhould be fitted to the Inſtrument by which it works, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to the Hand: And no man can with reaſon affirm that an houſe being to be built, the Inhabitant or owner is to be brought to that; but that ſurely is to be modelled and framed according to the mind and Ranck of the Owner: So no reaſon is there to ſuppoſe the body ſhould give Law to the ſoul, in the nature (I mean) of it, and its actions: though it may have ſome force upon the manner of its actions: As the Hand makes the Pen to write, and not the Pen the hand, abſolutely: but a good and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Pen may be an occaſion to the Hand to write well or ill. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not the body of Brutes which makes the Soul brutiſh, nor the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man which makes the Soul humane: but on the contrary ſo, that as their natures are different, ſhould their original likewiſe differ; And this difference cannot be taken from the matter, becauſe the diverſity of the matrer ariſeth from the Form. And beſides, the Scripture telling us that God breathed into man the breath of Life, declareth withal that the Soul of man (as the Philoſopher himſelf ſpeaks) came <hi>from without doors</hi> and not <hi>from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> But this is ſaid of no other Creature.</p>
                     <p>A Second mortal Errour is that imputed to <hi>Origen, viz.</hi> That Human ſouls were created, but not ſingly and ſeparately, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of particular perſons, but all at once, and that together with the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55232:154"/>
Angels. That the Angels; as all other things (God excepted) were created, is to be received as an Article of Faith, but there is neither any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us by the Scripture or diſcovered by reaſon when they were ſo created: How then can any man poſitively ſay, that the ſouls of men were then created? this being then a groundleſs ſuppoſition, light and vain muſt needs be the inference from thence. Nay, not only is the Scripture ſilent in that Caſe: but expreſſes on the contrary the time when the Soul of man was made and that it was at his firſt Conſtitution according to the order of the Hiſtorie, which firſt deſcribes the manner how Man was made, and then adds, how God not put the ſoul into it which he had before made, but brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into it the breath of Life. So that as the breath, is not at all until it be actually breathed, no more was the Soul before it was thus infuſed by way of breathing. Again, the abſolute ignorance of the Soul of any ſuch pre-exiſtence: which it is not poſſible, if we may ſuppoſe it in one or two, that all Souls ſhouls be ſubject to. And I call this ignorance and ſtupidity rather than oblivion, as ſome Philoſophers the Authors of this opinion would have it. For though a man may forget what he did at ſuch a time, and that once he was in ſuch a place, and ſuch, and ſuch things befel him: yet who did ever forget that he had a Being? A man may through the ſtrong invaſion of ſome ſickneſs or diſtemper, ceaſe to underſtand any thing, as alſo in a profound ſleep: yet he is not properly ſaid to forget theſe. Some have forgot their own names, but never any that they were ſimply. And therefore ſome ancient defenders of this opinion ſeeing the incredibleneſs of this Forgetfulneſs, have with infinite impudence introduced perſons profeſſing they remembred what they were, and did ſome hundreds of years before they were in thoſe bodies they ſpake of theſe things in. Laſtly, How is it credible that that ſoul which is the fountain of Life, Senſe, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to the perſon where it is, ſhould ſo inform a thing diſtinct from it ſelf, and yet be ignorant of it ſelf? Surely it muſt be becauſe there was nothing to be known of it before it inhabited the Body.</p>
                     <p>A Third Errour depending upon this laſt, is that of <hi>Origen</hi> likewiſe, who affirmed that Souls being Spirits before they were committed to the body, were put into them as to ſo many priſons for their former diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wickedneſs, for their puniſhment. But againſt this (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons) <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Peluſium</hi> argueth well, thus, <hi>How vain and abſurd</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.

                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 29.</note> For though the Evil Spirit, ſuppoſed to be put into man, were the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55232:155"/>
Author of its own wickedneſs, yet when once that was ſo wicked, for to put it into man is to make man wicked.</p>
                     <p>Now this Image of God, ſo much ſpoken of in Scripture, and treated of by Divines, to the great honour of Man, we may underſtand to conſiſt in theſe five things Principally. 1. Wiſdom and Knowledg 2. Liberty of Will. 3. Juſtice and Holineſs. 4. Immortality, 5. Dominion. For when we ſpeak of the Image of God in Man, we muſt be ſure not to confound it with that proper to Chriſt, the Image of God. For firſt, that of man was made as we have heard, that of God, Chriſt, was neither made nor created, but begotten; and that not by way of Carnal Generation, but purely divine and Spiritual. Secondly, That was as well Eternal in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of what is paſt, as what was to come: But the Image of God in Man, only everlaſting, as to the future time. Thirdly, That of Chriſt was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate: but that of Man mediate: So that he is not the Image of God, but as he is the Image of his more expreſs and Natural Image, Chriſt: and that firſt, as is ſaid in Wiſdom. Chriſt being primarily called the <hi>Wiſdom of his Father,</hi> and deriving of the ſame to us: For as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John. 1. 16</note> 
                        <hi>his fulneſs have all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> And God creating all things through his Natural Word, his Son, ſignified by that Metaphorical word expreſſed in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> did in particular through him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that Wiſdom unto <hi>Adam,</hi> which he excelled in, at his firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: whereby it was natural to him to underſtand the natures of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Earthly; as well from their Cauſes, from whence they proceeded, as from their effects proceeding from them: which latter is the principal means of attaining that remainder, and as it were ruins of a more perfect Body of knowledg in <hi>Adam,</hi> which we are capable of in the ſtate we now are. And not only Natural things but Supernatural alſo, as God, and the Holy Spirits, were much more perfectly known to him than to us. So that the knowledg of the Firſt man exceeded all after him (Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam</hi> only excepted) in theſe three things. Firſt, in the manner of enjoying that knowledg which he had: it being not acquired by tedious and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental diſcurſiveneſs, obſervations, or reaſoning within himſelf, but by a divine illumination: which was not given him after the manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations given by God to ſome of his eminent Servants, tranſiently; not to continue, or to deſcend to others, but it was by way of a connatural habit; which ſhould have paſſed to his poſterity. Secondly, the object of this knowledg or extent of it tranſcended that of Man now adayes, ſtretching it ſelf to heavenly, as well as Earthly things, and the minuter things lying hid from us. Thirdly, It differed in the manner, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as being more accurate, and leſs Fallible than ours.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing ſhining eminently in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Liberty</hi> of will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he reſembled his Creatour, who is the only abſolute and Free Agent: For there was no natural inclination nor temptation in him to err or offend in chooſing the Evil, and refuſing Good: according to that of <hi>Syracides God himſelf made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his Councel, &amp;c.</hi> Leaving it equally in his power and choice to turn to the<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 15. 14.</note> Right hand, or to the Left, to ſtand or fall. And not only freely to do what he did, though propelled thereunto; but freely to Act or not to act: which is the perfecteſt and moſt proper freedom of all.</p>
                     <p>From this twofold perfection of the Underſtanding and Will aroſe a Third, which was perfect Innocency and Holineſs: which by ſome is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Original Juſtice: and by others Original Grace; both ayming at the ſame
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55232:155"/>
thing: For <hi>Original Juſtice</hi> or Righteouſneſs it may be called becauſe it was not acquired, but connatural and ſimultaneous to the Being of Man: Again, It was Grace, becauſe though it pleaſed God to create man with it, yet he might alſo have created him without it, and it was ſeparable from him, and ſo not intrinſick to his very nature. Which is yet thus further to be underſtood, that it were moſt abſurd and blaſphemous to believe that God could make a man a ſinner without any precedent or concurrent act of his own will, or without this original innocency and Juſtice; for as nothing but God can proceed immediately and directly from Gods hand; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could man, as he was the effect of God, be any otherwiſe than Good. This then may be called his natural and Original Juſtice, and Goodneſs, and Original Grace alſo in ſome ſenſe, becauſe though all the works of God muſt needs be good, as his: yet man (for example) might not have been ſo perfect either in his underſtanding and will, and yet have retained inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. And this was the Grace of God: Beſides which may probably be aſſerted another Grace, which to the bare ſtock of Nature thus put together by God, ſuperadded a more ſpecial and Free Grace called (though not very properly) the Grace of Sanctification, not as it is in us, purifying and reſtoring us in ſome competent manner to what hath been decayed or depraved by the fraud and power of the Devil in us, or our own vile hearts and affections; but by way of Preſervation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the evils and dangers unto which we were ſubject. Now this, as it is called <hi>Grace</hi> becauſe it was not neceſſarily due to nature; So was it called <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Original,</hi> becauſe God conſerred the ſame at our firſt being, and would ſo have continued it, had we not abuſed and forfeited the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And from hence ſprang a <hi>Fourth</hi> beam of the bright Image of God in man, <hi>viz. Immortality,</hi> as an appendage to the ſaid Natural Juſtice, and a reward of the perſeverence in it. For God ſaying, <hi>In the day thou eateſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>thereof</hi> [the tree of the knowledg of Good and Evil] <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> did imply that ſo long as he perſevered in due ſubjection and obedience to his will, he ſhould not dye. So that <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſimply and in his own nature immortal, as were Angels, and immaterial Spirits, but by this Supernatural Priviledg, and Grace of Juſtice given of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was well able to perſevere in that ſtate of Holineſs, and ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from falling into ſin; And a ſufficient argument of the former is, that Man before his fall, did, or was to eat and drink, as appeareth from the indulgence of God to him, ſaying, <hi>Of every tree of the Garden</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>thou mayſt eat.</hi> Now eating and drinking do neceſſarily of themſelves inferr ſuch an alteration both in the body eating, and eaten, as tendeth to corruption, and therefore a more immediate hand and power of God was required to obviate that propenſity. And the manner of propagation being contrary to the imagination of ſome of the Ancients by that natural way that now it is, though much purer, prove the ſame inclination to diſſolution, and the neceſſity of a Divine Grace to ſecure man from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And thirdly, it is proved from the manner of the Fall, which ſpoiled us not of any thing natural, in a proper ſenſe to us: but loſt to us the Supernatural Aids, which otherwiſe ſhould never have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken us.</p>

                        <hi>appears to one as a certain truth that the Divine Nature inſpects the life of all Mortals: and that neither the Good, nor Evil Acts of men go for nothing, but naturally there follows different rewards for Good and Evil men.</hi> This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is that outward ground inferring Providence: but the Inward taken from God himſelf, is his Knowledg or Omniſcience: which the better to judge of, we may diſtinguiſh according to the Object of it, into knowledg of it, into knowledg of things within himſelf, or of himſelf, which is more Internal; and things without himſelf, external.</p>
                     <p>For if we ſhould ſpeak more Properly, God knoweth nothing by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abſolute direct knowledg, but himſelf; and all other things, Relatively, rather; according as they bare relation to him in <hi>being</hi> or <hi>not being;</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ike him as that which is Good, or diſlike him, by which manner he underſtandeth Evil. And nothing but God himſelf can perfectly know God, no not the higheſt and moſt divine Spirits attending him more immediately in the ſtate of Glory: becauſe perfect knowledg doth not conſiſt in an Apprehenſion that God is, or that he is infinitely glorious and Perfect: but in comprehenſion to know him as he is. True: St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>We ſhall know him as he is:</hi> meaning that in the ſtate of glory we ſhould have a much nearer and clearer acceſs unto his divine nature, than we can have here by the Organ of our Faith: And that ſo we ſhall ſee him, that there will be no more uſe of Faith, or outward information from revealed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, but Inward Revelations and illuminations ſhall immediately flow into us from God, to the fuller apprehenſion of him, and ſatisfaction of the reſtleſs mind of man. But to know him, as he is, is the Property of himſelf incommunicable to any Creature. For <hi>to comprehend a thing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, is nothing elſe but ſo to know it, that nothing of it ſhould be unknown to the Knower.</hi> As a Veſſel is ſaid to contain ſuch a quantity of liquor, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be left out. And thus God only, and no Created being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth God comprehenſively.</p>
                     <p>The Relative knowledg of God in order to things external, is to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated according to the Variety of things ſo known by him: yea not only the knowledg, but even the very <hi>Being</hi> of God is deſcribed unto us;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55232:157"/>
according to the manner of outward things: All things of reality, and not merely imaginary, are by general conſent divided into three ſorts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the three diſtinctions of time: Into things <hi>Paſt, Future,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> And therefore God is ſaid to be, <hi>He which is, and which was, and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 4. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>which is to come.</hi> Therefore ſurely the diſtinction of Gods knowledge moſt agreably to the nature of God and things known too, is, into that of things Paſt, Preſent, and to Come.</p>
                     <p>And there being no great difficulty or difference among Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two former; <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge of things paſt and preſent, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring that the knowledge of things paſſed, never paſſes with God, nor of things preſent, nor of future, but the Knowledge of all theſe being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and immoveably preſent with God, ſo that many more warily, will have all underſtanding in God to be rather Science, than Prae-ſcience; and Knowledge, rather than fore-knowledge: It were needleſs, as well as end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to enlarge thereupon.</p>
                     <p>The third, about things to come, deſerves more accurate enquiry. For, as to the diſtinction of Gods knowledge into that of <hi>Viſion,</hi> whereby he beholds all really exiſtent things; whether in themſelves paſt, preſent, or future: And that of <hi>Intelligence,</hi> it may be queſtioned, as common as it is. For we ſpeak not of poſſible, but actual knowledge: but that which may poſſibly be, but never ſhall be (the object of the ſuppoſed Intelligence of God) is only a poſſible knowledge, and not a real: and therefore, not to be matched with real knowledge. For to ſay, God knows the poſſibilities, is no more than to ſay, not that he knows the things, but himſelf, in whom, and to whom all things are poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Therefore confining our Diſcourſe only to things future, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch to be, either neceſſary or contingent; there being no mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two. And here firſt, What is that which denominates a thing neceſſary? and what contingent, or accidental? and then, in what reſpect they are ſo called and diſtinguiſhed? And here, firſt, we are to diſtinguiſh of neceſſity it ſelf, with the Schools. For there is a <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>abſolute</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; the contrary to which is altogether impoſſible, and ſo nothing but God is of Neceſſity. For God being abſolute and ſupream over all things, as nothing can, by way of anticipation, lay a neceſſity upon him; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing afterward obſtruct or neceſſarily impede his will: For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> It neither hath been at any time, nor can poſſibly be, That Gods <hi>reſolute Will</hi> ſhould be oppoſed ſo as not to obtain its deſigned end. But there is a conditional Neceſſity which they call Hypothetical, which hath no ſuch ſimple and original certainty, but dependent upon ſomewhat elſe. And this Dependance or Conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is either upon <hi>The firſt Cauſe,</hi> which is God; or ſome <hi>ſecond Cauſe,</hi> the Creature. For there was no ſuch abſolute Neceſſity that this viſible world ſhould have a Being, but this <hi>Being</hi> depended upon the Will and Pleaſure of God. And this world being, there was no neceſſity that it ſhould conſiſt of ſo many parts, or ſeveral kinds of things, but this depended upon the wiſdome and pleaſure of God alſo. The other Hypothetical Neceſſity was founded by the Firſt Cauſe, God, in the Creature; upon ſuppoſition that it had a <hi>Being,</hi> that ſuch ſhould be the nature of it: As that, ſuppoſing the Sun, it neceſſarily followed it ſhould give light; and ſuppoſing there be ſuch a thing as Fire in the world, there is a neceſſity it ſhould heat and burn: Of all which there can no other reaſon be render'd but that which <hi>Scotus</hi> gives, <hi>Becauſe this is this, and that is that:</hi> And becauſe the Creatour of them and all things elſe hath impoſed ſuch a Law unalterable upon the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55232:158"/>
of things themſelves; that upon ſuppoſal they have a Being, ſuch, and ſuch it ſhould be. And this I take to be that Neceſſity which Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call a <hi>Neceſſity of Conſequent: viz.</hi> that which is immediately conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the being of a Thing: that of <hi>Conſequence</hi> (as they call it) being nothing elſe but a rational Inference following upon ſome Particular ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: As the <hi>Genus</hi> is alwayes ſuppoſed to the <hi>Species,</hi> and not on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For example; He that runs, muſt of neceſſity move: and he that moves, muſt of neceſſity be: but not on the contrary. And the ground of theſe and all ſuch things, Neceſſity, is taken from the immutable decree of God, who hath ſo determined that things ſhould be: And not only is this true in things apparent and viſible to us, but muſt neceſſary be no leſs true in things inviſible, and to us obſcure and uncertain: <hi>viz.</hi> That upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal<note place="margin">Nihil est ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> of ſuch a peremptory Decree and Cauſe from God, that which ſeems to us moſt contingent and caſual muſt have a moſt certain and inevitable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; even not inferiour to any of thoſe neceſſities we have touched: and the reaſon is plain, becauſe here is ſuppoſed the ſame will, and ſame power to effect this, as them: and the variety and uncertainty of the means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a thing is brought about, makes nothing at all againſt this; becauſe this proceeds only form the relation ſuch means have to our underſtanding, and apprehenſion: which not being able to deſcern any connexion natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cauſe and the Effect, do look upon the effect as meer chance. For inſtance, that a fly ſhould kill a man by choking him is as contingent a thing as can ordinarily happen: And who could believe it, that ſhould be told that ſuch a fly moving lightly and wildly it knows not whether it ſelf, perhaps a mile off from the place where this falls out, and many dayes before the fact, ſhould certainly be the death of ſuch a man: yet no man of reaſon and conſcience can deny, but Gods providence and decree may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an inevitable neceſſity upon this creature ſo opportunely and fitly to move as that it ſhould certainly kill him, and that at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place. And if any ſhould hereof doubt, the expreſs aſſeveration of our Saviour Chriſt in the Goſpel may ſatisfie him herein, ſaying; One <hi>Sparrow ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father.</hi> If any ſhould ſo<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 29.</note> contrive our Saviours words as to underſtand <hi>without Gods will,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary only to Gods will, and not of Gods will concurring and his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge noting the ſame, St. <hi>Luke</hi> will inſtruct him otherwiſe, who renders<note place="margin">Luke 12. 6.</note> the ſame ſpeech, <hi>Not one is forgotten:</hi> which implies Obſervation, and Providence.</p>
                     <p>That therefore thoſe things which ſeem to us moſt free, irregular, and contingent, may have a tacit and unknown determination from God, which ſhould fix and infallibly limit them to ſome ſpecial ends, I may preſume no man can piouſly doubt: and eſpecially after that great Oppoſer of Gods Providence over humane actions, hath been conſtrained to acknowledge ſo much, I mean <hi>Socinus:</hi> who granteth God the liberty and power ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine<note place="margin">

For can we any more conceive that Gods good will to them ſhould firſt make them brutes, before it made them Saints in limiting their choice and determining the ſame to one ſide, rather than others? or that he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh a natural humane principle in them, to bring them to ſalvation; but

                        </gap> that there is no poſſible concord between Neceſſity and Contingencie. Indeed in the ſame reſpect, it muſt neceſſarily be true; whether we regard God or Man: For neither to God, nor to Man, can the ſame thing be allowed to be neceſſary and contingent at the ſame time: but there appears no reaſon, why the ſame thing, which is neceſſarily to follow on the part of God, may not be ſaid, on the part of man, to be fortuitous, free, and chance, as it is called. For we indeed vulgarly call that only <hi>neceſſary,</hi> where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a neceſſary connexion in nature, between cauſe and effect: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of evidence and aſſurance to us, we hold a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or contingent; in which ſenſe we hold it neceſſary, that an heavy body, out of its natural place, ſhould (left to it ſelf) deſcend to it and poſſeſs it. And we hold it not ſo neceſſary, that the Sun going down in a cleer red evening towards the Weſt, ſhould portend the day following to be fair and cleer: Our Saviour, when he affirmed this, ſpake after the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and opinion of men, which generally herein fail not. So that the being of a thing rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, and the appearing of it ſo to be, being ſo far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in nature, it follows not at all, that ſo it is intrinſecally, and of it ſelf; becauſe we can make no other judgment of it than in ſuch a manner: and that becauſe we perceive no natural connexion between the cauſe and effect neceſſitating it, therefore, there neither is, nor can be any. Some things God hath ordained ſo openly, inſeparable one from the other, that we eaſily and readily infer the one from or by the other: and this is all we call neceſſity, in nature. But if God more covertly and ſubtilty hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordained the like connexion, not by a Law of conſtant Nature, but his ſingular will (for which we can find out no reaſon) this we preſently call Contingent; though it be as certain as the other. And names being given to things by man, according as they are apprehended, the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things into Neceſſary and Contingent is very reaſonable, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to man; as ſignifying to him ſuch a diverſity of Effects in the world, that ſome have apparent natural neceſſary cauſe to produce them: and theſe things we call Neceſſary; and ſome things have no ſuch natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but more immediately are ordered by God bringing cauſes by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence together, beſides their nature, to produce ſuch an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that certainly, though not naturally; and this we call Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                     <p>That this manner of proceeding of the Providence of God, is poſſible; is impoſſible to be deſired. And in many things ſeeming to us as caſual as may be, that actually they are all granted. For to us, conſidering all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it was a thing meerly indifferent and undetermined, whether <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould believe unto Salvation or not? but conſidering the reſolute Providence of God diſpoſing certainly outward cauſes, it was certain and infallible. The great queſtion muſt then be about the General; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether God hath two immutable Laws whereby a neceſſity doth attend all effects, as well ſuch as we tearm free and contingent, as ſuch as are neceſſary; with this difference only, that on ſome things he hath laid a Law natural which ordinarily and neceſſarily moveth to one certain effect and end, as are ſeen in natural generations and corruptions, as that, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every ſeed ſhould have its own body; i. e.</hi> produce it. And<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> that whatever is ſo generated ſhould, by a Law of Nature alſo incline to diſſolution again. And that by a private inviſible Law which reſerves to him, or particular decree he certainly bringeth to paſs even thoſe things
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55232:159"/>
of which we can give no reaſon, and there appears to us no connexion or order of cauſes; but cauſes are by his ſpecial hand brought to effect ſuch things, as in their general nature they had no tendencie unto? The diſtinction common amongſt Philoſophers of <hi>Fortuna</hi> and <hi>Caſus; i. e.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Caſualty; and calling that <hi>Fortune</hi> which contingently falls out to free Intelligent Agents acting: and that <hi>Caſualty,</hi> which beſides natural intention, happens to fall out, may ſeem to clear this. For if we ſhould affirm that in natural things there were no ſuch indifferencie really, but all things were preciſely and particularly determined by God in his private counſel, however a wide latitude ſeemeth to us to be left them, to move, and act; or not to act; or to move and act thus; or not thus, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe; no great abſurdity or inconvenience would follow. For what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity could be inferred, if a man ſhould ſay, That the Eagle letting fall a Tortoiſe upon the bald head of the Philoſopher of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> walking in the field, and ſo beating out his brains, was determined neceſſarily ſo to do of God: or that the tree that fell down in a wind and killed him that walked out to preſerve himſelf from the fall of his houſe, which he feared, was inevitably appointed ſo to do? Theſe effects did not proceed from the nature of theſe cauſes themſelves, but a Superiour hand: and yet might be no leſs neceſſary than ſuch effects, of which the common reaſon of man can give an ordinary and eaſie account. And if this be granted in ſome things, it doth lye upon them who deny it in all, to render a reaſon of the difference, and not on them who affirm a paritie, by infinite inſtances to prove: it being ſufficient to ſay, There can nothing be ſhown to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But in things rational, and endowed with a power of Election and Rejection, it muſt be confeſſed, that the difficulty is much greater, becauſe there ſeems to be a repugnancie to free will, in ſuch tacit neceſſity, and God ſhould ſeem to take away with one hand, what he had given with the other. And therefore, of this in a more convenient place; after we have ſpoken ſomewhat preparatory thereunto, concerning the Decrees of God; which are internal acts of the Providence of God.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> The method of enquiring into the Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God: <hi>Vorſtius</hi> his grounds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the Attributes of God from his Nature, examined. Of the Decrees of God depending on his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will. Of knowledge of Intelligence. Viſion, and the ſuppoſed Middle knowledge: The Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this Middle knowledge invented in God. How Free Agents can be known by God in their uncertain choice. Indifferent Actions in reſpect of Man not ſo in reſpect of God. All Viſion in God ſuppoſes certainly in the thing known.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF the Holy Scriptures leaving us many precedents, have thereby warranted, or at leaſt permitted us to ſpeak of God after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mans body, aſcribing unto him head, eyes, mouth, hands and feet; and, the better to perceive the things of God, much more may we be allowed (if at all to ſearch into Gods nature) to regulate our enquiry of God from the nature of mans mind, and the more ſupream acts of his ſoul. The firſt Act of which is his apprehenſion and knowledge; with judgment following thereupon. The next in order is the Act of his will; and this Order we may beſt follow in the enquiry into Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is conſtituted (according as we can judge) of knowledge and will, whoſe proper act it is, to decree.</p>
                     <p>And here firſt, It is requiſite that we take notice of the folly and groſs impiety of <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> a late Pragmatick in Divine Myſteries: who would needs diſtinguiſh God from himſelf, and taking him at his word, wherein, ſpeaking after the manner of men, ſuch diverſity is mentioned, concludes that God and his Attributes, are really diſtinct in nature, one from another. And why did he not, by the ſame rule, conclude that Gods very <hi>Being,</hi> his Eſſence was diſtinct really from it ſelf, as well as from the ſuppoſed Accidents he (Epicurean-like) feigns to God. For God is no leſs affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have heart, hands, and feet, than to have Underſtanding and Will? And if it be granted, there is a figurative and no proper ſenſe in the one caſe, why may it not be in the other? And that God is all theſe things <hi>Eminently,</hi> but not after the formality of mankind.</p>
                     <p>The matter will be cleared better by examining his prime arguments ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Decrees of God, our preſent ſubject. Firſt, ſayes he, The decrees of God are various and many: but the Eſſence of God is but one:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55232:160"/>
therefore they muſt be really diſtinct. To which the anſwer is as obvious, as the argument preſumptuous: That if the Decrees were really many, they muſt of neceſſity be really diſtinct as well from themſelves, as God. But their plurality is rather Relative than Abſolute. All the Acts of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one pure ſimple Act, as in him; but denominated divers from the event, or relation they bear to the Creature. This is one of the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in his Chriſtian Catechiſe; and why did he (pretending to reaſon) leap over this, and not firſt diſprove it; and then proceed to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? It was a great piece of folly therefore in him to prove a real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Gods Attributes before he had proved that the Nature of God was compounded, or would admit of any ſuch oppoſition. For they who deny this, will certainly deny that.</p>
                     <p>Another of his reaſons is, The decrees of God are free; becauſe they might have not been, as well as have been. But Gods nature is not ſo. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a twofold freedom in the Decrees of God. The one in reſpect of the Nature of God, as God is preciſely conſidered, which, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from all Acts, was indifferent to others, as well as thoſe Decrees made: And the other in reſpect of the Creature or object, which was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of other Decrees; and therefore were Gods Decrees ſaid to be free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we all know that diſtinction of Inſtants in Order and Nature, do not infer a neceſſary diſtinction in duration: but that both Nature and Decrees might be coequal in eternity. Now all things that are eternal are in ſome caſe neceſſary. And the Schools have ſuch a diſtinction of Decrees, as they have of nature; <hi>viz. Decretum Decretans,</hi> and <hi>Decretum Decretatum,</hi> meaning that the Decrees of God are ſometimes uſed for the Act of God decreeing, and ſometimes for the thing decreed: And of this latter it may be ſaid, That the Decree of God is produced and made (which is a third ſpecial argument of <hi>Vorſtius:</hi>) but of the other, it cannot ſo be affirmed: but it may flow from him by an eternal Law, or Volition within himſelf, and not at all occaſioned by the Creature. And it is therefore ſaid to be free, becauſe it was not impoſed upon him, and therefore neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not acceſſary to him or contingent; but proceeding from him, as a natural and neceſſary, yet voluntary Agent. For we muſt not look upon God as ſubject to the condition of the Creature, in whom natural neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not compatible with voluntary freedom; but with God it may: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Creatures natures and wills are the ſame really, or formally; but the Nature of the Creatour and his will are formally diſtinct, and admit deſervedly of a diverſe conception, but really are the ſame: ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is harſh to the apprehenſion to conceive, yet the thing it ſelf may be, and really is ſo. Which ground laid doth reſolve that doubt alſo, concerning the generation of Chriſt, which is ſaid to be both voluntary and natural, and neceſſary: Voluntary and free, becauſe not conſtrained; and again neceſſary, becauſe not indifferent, or poſſible to be otherwiſe: for as much as it is not poſſible that God ſhould not have been, and Chriſt is God. Yet muſt we here put a wide difference between the Decrees of God in reference to the Creature; and the Paternal Act in reference to God the Son. For in this latter, we cannot ſo much as ſuppoſe an antecedent Decree; but only a natural Volition: In the former, we may conceive both a Decree going before, and a Preſcience anticedent to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the nature of Gods Decrees themſelves, we are to conſider that a Decree being an Act principally of the Will, and the Act of the Will in order of Nature poſteriour to the Acts of the Underſtanding; it ought
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55232:160"/>
firſt be enquired what Relation the Knowledge and Decrees of God bear one towards another. And here we muſt reſume the received diſtinction of Knowledge of <hi>Simple Intelligence,</hi> as they call it, or pure Underſtanding; and the Knowledge of <hi>Viſion</hi> in God: By the firſt is meant the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things poſſible to come to paſs by the Divine Power, to which nothing is impoſſible: By the Second, the underſtanding of all things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And becauſe things future are ſo various as we have ſhown, that ſome are future neceſſarily, and ſome unneceſſarily; therefore hath there been invented, and with much applauſe offered to the world, a Third kind of Knowledge of God, termed [<hi>Media Scientia] the Mean Knowledge;</hi> as comming between both the former; and having for its object, neither that which by a ſimple neceſſity ſhall come to paſs, nor that which is ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and contingent; but though in nature of outward cauſes contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, upon ſuppoſition made, certain and infallible to God. To all which, I offer theſe exceptions, firſt that this laſt diſtinction ſeemeth altogether ſuperfluous, or gives occaſion altogether as juſt to introduce innumerable other, no leſs reaſonable than that. For if from ſuch ſmall variety in the object, as we ſhall ſhow this to be founded on, new diſtinctions are to be coyned, there will never be any end of diſtinguiſhing Gods Knowledge. For if for conditionate things, a conditionate knowledge ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and acknowledged, then likewiſe according to the diſcrimination of conditions found in the Object, a different knowledge is to be imagined and diſtinguiſhed in God: which were confuſion and not diſtinction. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this mean or conditionate Knowledge cannot be entertained by ſober men as a diſtinct <hi>Species</hi> from the other two more ancient, but as a Part of that called the Science of <hi>Viſion,</hi> whereby all future things are known to God: as being it ſelf, about future things though with a condition. For all things are either future, or not future: If they be not future, but only poſſible to come to paſs, then are they the objects of that <hi>Simple Intelligence,</hi> though very improperly, as is ſaid: If they be future, then are they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the object of <hi>Viſion</hi> in God. Again, if of future things, ſome being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me conditional only; ought we not rather to conform the Act of Viſion to the Object; and diſtinguiſh Viſion into that of things certain and abſolute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of things certain only upon a ſuppoſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to frame a <hi>new nothing</hi> to explicate ſomething, which was clearer without it? The thing we oppoſe not, nor forty ſuch more, as might be no leſs reaſonably impoſed on the world; but the impertinencie, vanity, fraud of the terms, occaſioning greater obſcurity and contention than the world was acquainted with before. Thirdly, the very ſuppoſition here made to found this diſtinction will not hold the tryal; that is, that there is any thing ſo abſolutely future, that it ſhould come to paſs without a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or that there were any knowledge in God not conditional, in reference to created things, unleſs we ſhould peradventure except the firſt matter of all, made of nothing, and to which no outward or natural Cauſe did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, but the immediate will and decree of God produced it: but to all other effects from the beginning of the world to the end of it, ſomewhat of the nature of a condition was required to bring them to paſs; even to man was required earth. And God did not ſo abſolutely, by his Preſcience or Viſion ſee man future, but a Condition was taken into that knowledge; <hi>viz.</hi> matter preceeding: however he might have produced him without it. And not to multiply Inſtances to this purpoſe, God doth not fore-ſee, or ſee that any natural or neceſſary Cauſe ſhould take effect, but upon the condition of the due application of Actives and Paſſives. Therefore the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55232:161"/>
ſum of all, and the beſt end we can make here ſeems to me to be this: That we diſtinguiſh Conditional Knowledge in God, into that of <hi>Natural Agents,</hi> and <hi>Free Agents.</hi> For as God ſees ſome things future upon ſuppoſition of a capacity nature is put into, to Act, as that a Stone ſhould move down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon ſuppoſition that it be firſt removed from the Centre, and then that Impediments be with-drawn (for otherwiſe he ſees only that it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable down-ward,) ſo doth he ſee ſome things future, upon ſuppoſition that Free Agents be put into a capacity to exert themſelves: As that, at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching at <hi>Athens, Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and <hi>Damaris</hi> ſhould cleave to him, but the far greater number of Auditors ſhould forſake him, at his preaching of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The main doubt here to be reſolved will be this, What certainty there can be in Free Agents to found an infallible knowledge in God, ſeeing if they be not certainly known determined, they cannot be certainly known as determined? for this were to know them a-miſs, and would be an error. And to be determinable, is quite another thing from knowing them actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined. Again, If they be determined, and that certainly; (For uncertain determination is no determination, in truth) how can they be ſaid to be free, and have the power of Election? To this it was wont to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by vertue of <hi>Media ſcientia,</hi> or <hi>middle kind of knowledge</hi> in God: That God doth not ſee effects infallibly to flow from ſuch Free Agents, becauſe of any antecedent influence inclining certainly the will to one way; but by vertue of that general ſtock of liberty with which he hath endowed Rational Agents to act freely, he ſees, upon ſuch and ſuch circumſtances and propoſals, the Will of it ſelf to move one way; which ſuch ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination being known to God renders him truly Preſcient and Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and that without errour.</p>
                     <p>But this will not ſtand the encounter. For Gods knowledge about the Creature, being wholly conditional, as we have ſhewed (ſuppoſing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of natural Cauſes in natural Effects, and free Cauſes, to free Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects) there will be no Cauſe to be found, or imagined in nature, why two equally by nature Free, ſhall extreamly differ in their choice of the ſame object: How can that be known which neither hath a being in it ſelf, nor its Cauſes? But the Caſe in hand is ſuch. For the Object being the ſame to both, and the Subject being the ſame in both, Freedom of Will to choſe: it is not intelligible how it ſhould be fore-ſeen, that one will certainly tend this way, and the other, the Contrary. And if there be a difference in the Wills, St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> queſtion ſo often and preſſingly urged againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> will put them hard to it to anſwer; <hi>viz. Who made thee to differ?</hi> and, <hi>what haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> Comes it from a mans ſelf, as free? If ſo, then it ſhould come from all alike, where all are alike free: and if all be not alike free, then there is difference made to their hand, and not by themſelves. Again, the common Argument will be of no ordinary force upon them, which layeth this undeniable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken foundation, <hi>That God is the Cauſe of all Cauſes, and the Firſt mover in all natural actions and motions:</hi> but here (as ſome of the Schoolmen, and amongſt others <hi>Suarez</hi> by name hath it) God ſhould ſtand ſtill, look on,<note place="margin">

                     <p>But they proceed farther, and ſay, That God having indued the Free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with ſufficient abilities to Act, the original cauſe of Acting muſt be

                        </gap>ved to him. But to this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That three things are to be conſidered in indifferent Actions; The Power to Act, which is indifferent: The Determination of this power to one, which takes off the indifferencie; and the Action it ſelf, which in the execution, is neceſſary: becauſe as the Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ome hath it, <hi>Every thing when it is, neceſſarily is.</hi> Now the latter indeed may be aſcribed to God, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the firſt; as the true Author, upon general conceſſions of power; but the ſecond cannot: becauſe (what I think hath not been conſidered) there is a diſtinction to be made between the power of Acting, or not Acting, and Acting this or the contrary to it; and the power of determining it ſelf to one, rather than the other. For if, as in an equal ballance, the two Scales of mans Free-will are ſo evenly poſited, that they are no more propenſe to one, than the other ſide, the Affirmative, or Negative; doth it not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow there muſt be the help of a finger, or ſuch thing, to make a difference, though the leaſt touch will do it? So that the power of moving up or down is plainly one thing, and the power of determining the ſame, quite another here, and ſo likewiſe in mans Free-will made free, and thus indifferent by Grace; which they call ſufficient: though this will not be allowed by ſuch as require a particular and immediate converſe of God to all Actions; as did likewiſe the moſt Philoſophical Heathens, as I could ſhow. From whence we may collect that God ſeeing nothing but what has a real being, in it ſelf or Cauſes; and the Power of Acting being not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give a being to an effect, but the Execution of that Power: if this Execution hath no cauſe, it cannot be known; and it hath no immediate cauſe until man hath actual being, according to that opinion that makes man the abſolute cauſe of determining his actions, and not God: For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man cannot determine before he hath exiſtence, and therefore it cannot be, and therefore neither known to be, ſo much as future: For man before he is, can give no cauſality to this determination; and they ſay God doth give none; Therefore it is not at all, and cannot at all be known of God. Neither can it be ſaid, That things future are Real Beings, though not Actual and Preſent, and ſo may be known of God: becauſe that which is future cannot be actually known but as it is actual, and not ſimply future; and therefore is the knowledge of God by more accurate ſpeakers truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Viſion,</hi> rather than <hi>Praeviſion.</hi> And thoſe things that are future as to their proper Exiſtence, are preſent as to their Cauſes in Gods counſels, but if there be no ſuch to be found with God, then can there be no ſuch Cauſes at all: For that cannot be ſaid to be the Cauſe of a thing which at the ſame time is the Cauſe equally of the contrary, or contradiction to that thing: but the undetermined will of Man is indifferent to both ſitting ſtill or walking, at the ſame time; no cauſe inclining to one, more than other: which ſhould found a certain knowledge of one, and not of the other.</p>

                     <p>TO the vindicating the former Diſcourſe from juſt reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will here be expected that we explain our ſelves in anſwer to theſe following Quaeries. Firſt, <hi>Whether the knowledge of God be the Cauſe of things future; or things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Cauſe of his knowledge?</hi> or otherwiſe, <hi>Whether God knows a thing becauſe it ſhall come to paſs;</hi> or, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, becauſe God knows it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In anſwer to which, we muſt diſtinguiſh a twofold knowledge in God. An <hi>Ideal</hi> knowledge and a <hi>Real</hi> knowledge (as we may be allowed to ſpeak after the manner of Men, reſerving ſtill to God his abſolute ſimplicity.) The <hi>Ideal</hi> knowledge of God is that, whereby he perfectly knows all things in their proper forms, which are poſſible, and intelligible: And this doth not depend at all upon his Decrees, which we make the Cauſe of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in the Creature; but the Decrees of God depend upon this: God decreeing nothing to be future, which he firſt by ſimple intuition beholds not in its proper Nature and Circumſtances; as men of Contemplation firſt weigh the nature, means, and ends of things, before they reſolve upon them. But the <hi>Real</hi> knowledge, which we ſignally ſo call becauſe it relates to the Real Exiſtence of the thing ſo known, does certainly depend upon the antecedent Decree of God: no poſſible reaſon being to be rendred, why God ſhould know a thing to be, but becauſe it is certainly, and not fallibly to him, to be: And no poſſible reaſon being to be found, why a thing ſhould ſo infallibly be to him, but becauſe he hath reſolved &amp; decreed that ſo it ſhall be. From whence may be reconciled the frequent ſayings of the Ancient, and ſome Modern Divines, who have ſaid, That God fore-ſees a thing becauſe it is to be: and not that it is, becauſe God ſees it. For the ſeeing of a thing <hi>abſolutely</hi> and the ſeeing it to <hi>be,</hi> are vaſtly diſtinct notions. And moſt true is that obſervation to be found (as I remember) amongſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers concerning the difference between the Underſtanding of God, and its Object; and the Underſtanding of Man, or Angel, and its object. For in the Intellectual Part (for I uſe the word <hi>Underſtanding</hi> now, and not for the Act, as even now) of the Creature, Underſtanding is cauſed from, and by the Object, to the faculty repreſented; and the Object makes the knowledge, and not the knowledge the Object: But on the contrary, the Underſtanding of God is many times operative, and makes its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:55232:162"/>A Second capital Doubt will be, <hi>How ſuch a perpetual and infallible</hi> Cauſation <hi>in the Creatour, upon the very Underſtanding and Will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rational, can conſiſt with the native Prerogative of Liberty of Will, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the ſame hand to it?</hi>

                     <p>The Anſwer to this hath coſt many a Volume, with no great ſatisfaction: and therefore how little may be expected from this <hi>Compendium,</hi> every equal Judge will eaſily ſee.

                     <p>And firſt, we are to diſtinguiſh of Free-will, as in Mankind, in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, from that which may be found in any one Individual man. For when the noted place of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> (which I will not quarrel at becauſe it is only <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi>) tells us, <hi>God made man from the beginning, and</hi>

And ſurely, this is no ſmall difference, whereof man may glory above beaſts: which is not wholly loſt to man, though in particular there ſhould be found a determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mans will to one. Secondly, Liberty is made up of two things neceſſarily, the Acts of Reaſon, and the Acts of Will. If any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination were made of Mans actions in the Individual, that Reaſon were lockt up, and could not ſtir, or move in man; or when reaſon out of its native power, remaining, did argue and debate things variouſly, there were no power left in the Will to follow the Dictates of it, but was driven like an horſe in a Cart, by the fierce voice and whip of the ſtander-by, then indeed all pretenſe to true Liberty muſt needs periſh, becauſe here were a Co-action of the Agent moving him to one thing.

I grant that in Cauſes co-ordinate, as Man and Beaſt; or Man and Man acting upon diſtinct principles, and ends, <hi>Neceſſitation</hi> from the One, quite ruins the Freedom of the other; and is unnatural and violent, being purely an external cauſe, giving no power to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55232:163"/>
the Will to move, but exciting and impelling it againſt the judgment and more rational concluſion of the underſtanding, to accept the terms given. But Neceſſity proceeding from the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Supream Cauſe,</hi> God himſelf, to whom all inferiour Cauſes are ſubordinate, doth not take away the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Freedom of Man. The Reaſon whereof is, becauſe the concurſe of the Firſt Cauſe is not extrinſecal to the Natural Agent, but really intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to it, and eſſential. And therefore the diviſion of Cauſes by Logicians, into Internal, as Matter and Form: and External, Efficient and end; holds good only in ſecondary Efficients, and not in the firſt, and univerſal Agent. For though it be moſt true that the Abſolute nature and Being of God is quite diſtinct from created being, and extrinſecal: yet it is not ſo, as he is a Cauſe. The reaſon of this will make it undenyable: becauſe, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by Chriſtian Philoſophers, the act of Creation in God is eſſential to the Creature, ſo produced; and the act of Conſervation is a perpetuation of that act creative in God; and therefore, alſo muſt needs be intrinſecal to the Creature; and the act of Gods concurſe moving the Creature and ſo determining it, is no other but a branch of that conſervative act in God, and ſo is intrinſecal to the Creature, that what the Creature doth, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſuch influence, it may no leſs be ſaid to do, of it ſelf (there being a Coalition of both acts, created and increated in one) than it may be ſaid to ſubſiſt of it ſelf, by its matter and form, of which it conſiſts. And this St. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine declares to us, where he puts no difference between our <hi>living, moving, and having our being</hi> in God, all alike depending on him,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note> and be equally intrinſecal to all. And therefore Gods action terminated in man, becomes his, as much as thoſe which we conceive to proceed from his own being: and notwithſtanding to this act of God primarily may be aſcribed the turning, as it were, of the Scales of the Will, yet may man alſo be ſaid herein to determine himſelf: the reaſon whereof is, That both the firſt Cauſe and the ſecond are here total Cauſes. But here I call to mind a <hi>Maxime</hi> amongſt Logicians, and others teaching of Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: <hi>That it is not poſſible that Two total Cauſes ſhould be ſubordinate,</hi> as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and inſtrumental Cauſe, one to the other; but muſt alwayes be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate: as two horſes moving a Chariot, no otherwiſe than one might well do alone; and two Candles giving but one light to the ſame place. I might queſtion this Axiome, and the Inſtances both, becauſe in the firſt, though both Horſes are the Cauſes equally of ſuch a motion, and ſo total: yet the immediate cauſes are not total: For it is certain, that the ſame force which is uſed by one, not riſing to that of both, would not in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner move the Chariot, that both actually do; though there be nothing more eaſie then for one ſo to move it. Neither are two Candles total Cauſes of that degree of light which is in the Room, though of light they may be: But whethen theſe mine exceptions againſt the preſumed Rule be rational or not, it matters not at preſent; it being to me certain that it holds only in ſecondary Cauſes jovntly working, and not in the concurrent motions of firſt and ſecondary Cauſes; becauſe of the eſſential dependence the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſe hath upon the firſt.

                     <p>There remains yet one more difficulty to be here touched, to which many may be reduced, and that is, That Man being thus determined and lying under this neceſſity of Acting, he cannot in juſtice be reſponſable for his Actions, whether good or evil. He cannot be the ſubject of praiſe or diſpraiſe. All
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55232:163"/>
preaching by Exhortation and Dehortation; All reward of Puniſhment and Benefits; Laſtly, All Prayers, and the uſe of it, muſt needs ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>To theſe in order briefly; And firſt in general, denying the reaſonableneſs or validity of ſuch conſequences, upon this common ground. That if indeed this were a neceſſity from a Co-ordinate Cauſe, not natural to the Agent moved by it, then it were to be lookt on as no act proper, and free in the Creature, but ſtrange to it, and violent, and by conſequence refunding all praiſe and diſpraiſe upon the unreſiſtible impulſe of that external Cauſe: but this is internal, natural, and one act really, of the firſt and ſecond Mover: and ſo properly, principally (as any Creature can be ſaid to be principal Agent under the Creature) and totally is the act of the ſecond Cauſe; which in external motions, otherwiſe than from God, it is not. And if it be ſaid, that from hence would follow, The Creature acting evilly, that this Evil might be equally imputable, unto God, and to the Creature; It may be replayed, that two things are to be conſider'd in Actions the nature of the Action it ſelf; and the morality of it. And that all things being good in nature, the act it ſelf is good and may be imputed to God, though the morality of the act be otherwiſe. But it may be demanded yet further: Have not this morality it ſelf a Nature, and conſequently upon the grounds laid imputable to God, as well when the act offends againſt juſtice and honeſty, as when it agrees with both? To this. Nature indeed (as hath upon another occaſion been ſhewed) is ſometimes taken very largely for any thing that hath a being, but here we take it only in the phyſical ſenſe, whereby things are ſaid to have a proper being But Good and Evil are rather <hi>modi reales</hi> (as they ſpeak in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks) then <hi>res; Manners of Being</hi> rather than <hi>proper Beings</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Again we muſt, and do hold with <hi>Auſtine</hi> that, Evil morally taken hath not ſuch a real being as Good hath: but is only the abſence or priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good; being no real Entity; and we pity, rather than fear ſuch an argument as we have found againſt this, that if Evil be nothing, then God ſhould be angry for nothing, when he is offended at ſin. For ſurely there is a great difference between Gods being angry for nothing, and Gods being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with nothing. What would they ſay, I marveil, when the Father in the Goſpel commanded his Son to go work in his vineyard, and he would not go? might he not be angry, even becauſe there was nothing done? And muſt this be called, being angry for nothing? So ſurely, God may be angry with mans doing nothing. Here in order to a more full account may be given of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, we leave in pawn this diſtinction, of the <hi>Act of Sin;</hi> and the <hi>Sin of the Act:</hi> And that God may concur to the former conſtantly, and never have a ſinger in the latter, which is properly the ſinfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now to the matter of praiſe or diſpraiſe: of which they are only ſaid to be capable, who act freely and upon election, and not upon neceſſity; I make no ſeruple directly to deny the truth of it, as famous as it is amongſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; Philoſophers, abſolutely taken. Nothing is more plain than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, every day: For we praiſe handſome Horſes, and handſome Men, and infinite other things when there was not the leaſt concurrence of the will, but God and Nature did all, to ſuch a laudable ſtate; much leſs any act conducing thereunto. And do we not in our Judgments diſcommend the diſproportions of natural monſters and creeples, though we out of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pity, declare not ſo much to their reproach? And this ſeems to have deceived <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> (who laid it down for a current Rule) that he diſtinguiſhed not theſe two. For certainly, Commendation and Diſcommendation rightly uſed, are the effects of our Judgment, and Will,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55232:164"/>
and Affections. But more nearly to the caſe, we anſwer, That ſuch Praiſe and Diſpraiſe are only vacated by ſuch a neceſſity as is extrinſecal to, and contrary to the will. but where the Act is affectedly done, there a ſuppoſed neceſſity doth not exempt from ſuch Rewards of Praiſe and Diſpraiſe, or Puniſhment or Benefits. But it is certain a man may ſtrongly affect that which he cannot chooſe but do.</p>
                     <p>And the like may be anſwered to that of Inſtruction, Exhortation, and Dehortation; all which, they ſay, ought to ceaſe, and would become unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary if mans will were ſo immoveably determined to one thing. Yea all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Deprecations were to no purpoſe. And why ſo? becauſe it is not in mans power to relieve himſelf: and whatever he ſaith, believeth, or doth, nothing can do any good, if the Decree be ſo againſt him: and nothing of all theſe omitted, or the contrary committed, hurt or endanger him; ſuch a Decree being for him. And what grounds of comfort to a troubled mind may be laid, the Caſe thus ſtanding? This is the ſum of all we are (here at leaſt) bound to take notice of. And this were much more than it ſeems to be, were it ſo, that they, who hold the contrary opinions, were not obliged as really (I ſay not in the ſame reſpects) to anſwer theſe difficulties. For who is there that doth not held an <hi>Intuitive</hi> knowledge of God of all things future? but they deny what the other, affirm, That ſuch knowledge is operative or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory upon the will of man, to infallibly determine ti; but will have Man be the Author of ſuch his reſolution only, and God to look on, and ſee it done, but not to do it. Well, be it ſo for once: yet ſtill the Will is certainly and irrevocably determined, or God could have no knowledge of it, but what is conjectural, and as unworthy of God, as the Creature is unworthy of Omniſcience. And if ſuch unalterable ſtate of the Will and Actions be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in man; it is not material, at preſent, to enquire from whence this Determination proceeded; from God, or from Man: we granting here, That if God had no hand in it, but Man, excluſively to God, was the cauſe of it, then the account would ſeem more grievous, and caſe more foul on mans part. This I ſay, is not much to our preſent purpoſe, which is to enquire of the Fact, whether ſo it be, or not determined: and that ſo it is, appears, that God ſees it is ſo. And if it be ſo, do not all thoſe fore-mentioned inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies come ſtrongly upon them? Mans deſtiny is certain by his own Act: he is unalterably now determined, he cannot go back: God ſees it is to be ſo with him, and therefore ſo it ſhall certainly be: And therefore what do we trouble our ſelves, or ſuch an one with inſtructing him, exhorting, threatning, promiſing him. It is too late, now: This ſhould have been done many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years before he was born, and before it was known by God for certain, that he will go this way: For God now by the vertue of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate middle knowledge doth infallibly know it ſhall be thus &amp; not thus. And as the ſervant in the Goſpel ſaid of <hi>Jairus</hi> his daughter, <hi>Thy daughter is</hi>

But this I may grant;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55232:164"/>
and yet ſtill have no ſatisfaction in that under queſtion, How, without, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and idleneſs, a man may take any pains about ſuch an one, or miniſter any comfort to him? accuſe him, and confound him he may a great deal more, by upbraiding him with his own ruin. <hi>Socinus</hi> indeed, that great wild Boar in Chriſts vineyard, who hath to his power rooted up the firſt Principles of Chriſtianity, and ſometimes (as in this caſe) of ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon and Philoſophy, to plant his baſtard ſlips, comes off very round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eaſily, by denying any certain knowledge in God, whether condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate or inconditionate, of things contingently future, as eſpecially thoſe of the Free Will: and thus to ſet man up-right upon his leggs, he brings God upon his knees.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe it is not ſo much my drift to ſhow what cannot be ſaid, as what may; I ſhall attempt to give ſome anſwer to the Objection upon the grounds I reſt on, and here chooſe; deſiring and expecting more clear and full ſatisfaction to them, when they ſhall have removed the obſtructions they are obliged to clear this point of, who are of another judgment. And firſt we muſt remember, That according to our Grounds, man doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf to Good or Evil, notwithſtanding God doth it too. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we hold that there is no ſuch abſolute determination of Man by God or Man, which taketh not ſo in with it, the proper conditions and means conducing thereunto. God nor Man do not reſolve upon good or evil withour the propoſal of the allurements of both, and the means conducing unto both. And 'tis generally agreed, That the Will of man cannot tend towards God (ſince his Fall) without the firſt Grace freely and irreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively given, and that it is of the ſame nature and order to the reſtitution or recreation of his ſoul; as was the firſt Matter to the framing of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And therefore, as that firſt matter was ſuch that man could not be made in Gods order, without it; and yet was not ſo neceſſarily made by it, but that he might never have been; or any thing elſe might have been made of it, had God ſo pleaſed: So the firſt Grace to Regeneration is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, but it is not abſolutely neceſſary that where this firſt Grace is, Regeneration ſhould follow; or the will of Man certainly incline to embrace it: For to embrace it, is an act of Spiritual life, and no Vital act can be exerciſed, but by a Vital Principle. And the firſt Grace is not ſo much a Principle of Actual Life, as a neceſſary Preparation to it. And therefore is required by all, that ſecond Grace, which giveth life: and a power of acting anſwerable to that life. Which power is actuated by the ſweet concurrence of God, and the Will of man determining to one. Now, as where many things may equally come to paſs, yet one thing eventually doth neceſſarily happen, and not the other: So is it in this ſelf-determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man: Inevitable it is, that one way be choſen, and there is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual neceſſity that one takes effect, but this is not from the Nature of the will of Man, neceſſary. And being from the nature of the thing unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; it muſt needs be unknown to man. And being unknown to man, can never oblige him to adhere to one part more than the other: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, being thus free, common reaſon will direct, and almoſt conſtrain him to act and carry himſelf, as undetermined and free. For 'tis as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and true a Rule in Divinity as other Faculties. <hi>Not to appear,</hi> and <hi>not to be, is in effect the ſame thing to a man.</hi> Now it is impoſſible, without ſupernatural Revelation (above the Scripture) which we never read, was ever heard of, and have no grounds it ſhall ever befall any man, that any man ſhould know that he hath conſpired ſo irreverſibly with the Juſtice of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55232:165"/>
God, as never to move to Good and be ſaved. For when the Scripture hath laid down this as a fundamental Rule: <hi>The Son of man is come to ſave</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 18. 11. John 12. 47. Acts 2. 38,</note>

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 21, 22.</note>

Even the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.</hi> And to theſe many other like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture may be added, declaring no man deſtined to incredulity or impenitency aforehand, until ſuch time as he hath declared againſt both, and that to the end of his Life. But on the other ſide rather, that God puts no difference. Now if St. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument held good (as certainly it did) that a wife ſhould not put away her husband who was an Infidel, nor the believing husband his wife, upon the grounds of ignorance of a good event: Should a man put away his Soul? <hi>For what knoweſt thou, O wife,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>whether thou ſhalt ſave thy husband? Or how knoweſt thou, O man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> So, what knoweſt thou, O man (who doubteſt of Gods Decrees) whether thou ſhalt ſave thy ſoul? Whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That it is no ground of diſcomfort that the event is determined: for it is equal on our ſide, as much as againſt us: but it is the ground of all reaſonable ſatisfaction from the General Law requiring obedience E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical, and from the Promiſes made without any diſcrimination: which a man cannot apply to his diſadvantage or diſcouragement, without being firſt guilty of unreaſonableneſs and unnaturalneſs to himſelf. Now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the deſigns thereof, do ſuppoſe a man a true natural man to himſelf, before it attempts to draw him to an higher good, or nobler ends. So that if a man will deny his own natural reaſon, and ſelf-love due to himſelf, ſuch a man is indeed no fit perſon to be treated with, any more than a direct mad man: but this natural reaſon ſuggeſts to him, that where he knows it not to be an invincible Evil which he is to contend with, and knows not but that the way is as eaſie, the door as open, the means as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to him as any man living, to attain happineſs, he is to take heart and courage, and reſolution to effect his deſires. For to omit a certain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith and Hope, upon an obſcure and uncertain ground is monſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ridiculous. I conclude therefore, that, as almoſt all the actions of mans life, yea and his life it ſelf, which are no leſs determined with God, then the ſtate of Grace or Wickedneſs, Glory, or Miſery, do not cauſe him to ſuſpend endeavours leading to the end propounded to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo neither in the Concernments of his ſoul, keeping his natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to himſelf entire, can he obſtinately refuſe to act according to the ends of Religion. Yet I might adde this alſo, which is moſt true; that if it were revealed to a man that he ſhould never eſcape damnation, do he what he can, or what he will; yet that deſperate careleſneſs and loſeneſs could not be but greateſt ſtupidity, becauſe God doth certainly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſalvation and damnation, as to the degrees of them, to the degrees of Holineſs and Sins in this Life; and therefore it were more than worth a mans time and diligence, by a more reſtrained and Chriſtian converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to obtain a mitigation of the evil he ſo fears. And yet that part of the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55232:165"/>
argument commonly uſed, which ſaith, That it is in vain for a man who is ſo determined to ſtrive to free himſelf, and to abound in religious acts; is directly falſe, and to be denyed. For no good works ſhall go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: And this is no leſs infallibly true, <hi>That</hi> to him <hi>that hath, ſhall</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 20. Rom. 2. 8, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>more be given,</hi> and to him that doth righteouſneſs: and <hi>to them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory and honour and immortality; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</hi> And that the external acts and means are effectual to theſe great ends, Chriſt tells us ſaying, <hi>To you that hear ſhall</hi> more <hi>be given,</hi> than<note place="margin">Mark 4. 24.</note> that Gods Grace is neceſſarily required to all true Converſion and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>I know thoſe of <hi>Dort</hi> following <hi>Calvine</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and ſuch of eminencie in Reforming, anſwer otherwiſe; But in truth their Reply is no Anſwer. For granting an invincible ſtate of unregenerateneſs, and a total inſufficiencie in Man to free himſelf, without the effectual Grace of God, yea, and an irreverſibleneſs in Gods Decrees, ſo that all endeavours and acts ſhould be fruſtrated to the obtaining the bleſſed end generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and the terrour of thoſe under this Neceſſity; they oppoſe only good counſel to this, and much more; and reprove them lightly at leaſt that meditate too much on the ſeverer part of Gods Decrees, the abſtruſer Counſels of him, and determinations to the taking them off from thoſe good duties, which God without exception requires of all. But all this and the like to this, is very little or nothing to the purpoſe: For they certainly hereby betray their Cauſe, and grant the whole argument to be good, and duly to infer all that is intended by it: only they oppoſe barely the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and would not have it take place, though they can find no fault with that it is grounded on: What a miſerable ſhift is it for any, who are not able to deny that, upon their own reaſon, ſuch a thing follows; to ſay, Yea, but this ought not to be, and to perſwade contrary to conviction of themſelves, as well as others: But occaſion will be given of theſe matters more fully, in what follows.</p>

opinion of theſe muſt not paſs for <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion, without this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtinction. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and ſuch Fathers as followed him (and it was ſome hundred of years before any Father of repute in the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to confront him in his known doctrines, in this point) affirmed an infallible Predeſtination to Life and Death: but he did not ſo affirm it, that this ſhould be done abſolutely, without any conſideration of the way and means leading thereunto: this thoſe Divines now named held, and thoſe of <hi>Dort</hi> generally, called the <hi>Supralapſarian way,</hi> very irrationally and impiouſly. Their main reaſon is this, That God could not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſo much inconſiderateneſs, and imprudence, as no man of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reaſon could be guilty of: <hi>viz.</hi> To make a thing before he knows what to do with it. Firſt therefore they conclude, That God muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to himſelf a certain end, and that not common and general, which is his Glory: but ſpecial, to each man in the laſt ſtate of all: and thence infer, That he muſt (as men call for ſeveral tools, or inſtruments for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral works, and ends) predeſtinate the means thereunto. This argument was uſed long before <hi>Calvine,</hi> by <hi>Scotus,</hi> and in effect the ſame, though minc'd a little by him: who declares plainly that God muſt firſt propound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an end, and then order the means agreeable to that end. Yet is <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſuffer'd to paſs, and little ſaid to him: But <hi>Calvine</hi> bears all the blame. And ſurely blame-worthy he is. As on the other ſide, that later, rank, and careleſs Pen which would, by no means ſuffer that there ſhould ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable deſtruction attend any man of Gods making, becauſe, forſooth, this were to make God like to a fooliſh workman, who ſhould make a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work, only to deſtroy it, and break it to pieces. But ſetting aſide the odiouſneſs of the compariſon, the thing it ſelf ſuppoſed is falſe, and that many wayes: Firſt, that it would be ſuch a piece of impardonable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a man to make a thing which he reſolved to deſtroy again, when he had done his will with it. It is indeed hard to conceive that any man ſhould be ſo ſtupid as to have no end of a thing, but that it might not be, ſo ſoon as it hath a beginning: for ſurely, either profit or delight intermediate was the principal, and rational Motives thereunto; and therefore ſecondarily he might ordain the very diſſolution of his work: as a man doth, who having made a curious mould, breaks it to pieces, and ſo at firſt intended, before it was made; ſo ſoon as he had perfected his more principal intention. But were it ſo that this could not be done without extream folly on mans part; yet the ſame might be done without the leaſt juſt ſuſpicion of miſtake on Gods part. For man is certainly a fool who ſtudieth or laboureth about a thing which bringeth him no real advantage, or deſtroyes a thing which doth. But God receiving no ſuch advantage from the ſaved, or ſuch diſadvantage from the damned; where is the imprudence? But laſt of all, Damnation is indeed deſtruction in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but not proper ſenſe.

But the contrary is plainly the truer: that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth no other ultimate end than himſelf in his acts of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And therefore, though God hath revealed himſelf (an act of his free Grace) in his holy Word, that he willeth not the death of a ſinner: and much leſs of a perſon that is innocent before him; and it were moſt blaſphemous
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55232:167"/>
to Gods truth and mercy to affirm, That, as the caſe ſtands between him and man, he will, or may condemn to everlaſting pains, Man not juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them, yet there appears not any reaſon, conſidering the abſolute dominion of the Creature belonging to him, that of himſelf he might not ſo have diſpoſed of him. They may ſay, That God in juſtice can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way no more than he gave to his Creature: be it ſo. The capacity of the beatifical Viſion God gave man: and therefore may take it away: And what is that but extream miſery? <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> makes the loſs of Gods glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to be greater than the pains of ſenſe ſuffered by the damned. And do we not ſee thus much before our eyes frequently, That God cauſes many to come into this world, who wear-out a miſerable life without any good day, in continual languiſhings and ſickneſſes? Surely this is not without cauſe going before: But yet no more cauſe then is common to others, living in proſperity and eaſe.</p>
                     <p>This may be diſputed, and perhaps, better omitted; but not ſo that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which makes irreſpective Predeſtination to glory and miſery, becauſe God muſt firſt propound his end: making no great difference between the Predeſtination to the means of a good end, and the means towards a bad one: but that God, to bring about this, as well as that, doth with like concurſe, and will, deſign evil means to evil ends, as he doth good to good ends; or that he is the direct Authour of ſin to prepare men to damnation as he is of good acts leading to life and glory. Theſe contain two great errours to be liked of no good Chriſtian, for any mans great name, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Reformation. For it is firſt, certain, that though ſometimes in Scripture, the ſame name may be aſcribed to Gods Providence in both, yet it is in a far different ſenſe: as the Relation that Gods hand and power<note place="margin">Quia univerſa ista Maſſa me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritò damnata eſt, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here then cometh in the diſcriminating will and hand of God: Some part of this he leaves, and ſome he chooſes. Some part he ordaineth eſpecially and directly to Life and Grace; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuffering to fall into deſerved ruin, he is ſaid to deſtine or predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to periſh; and ſometimes not only upon the ſtock of original pravity, odious ſufficiently unto God, to provoke to that: but by actual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal impieties and errours, naturally tending to ſuch ends. So that as it is neceſſary there ſhould be an hand to lift a man up, who is fallen down and maimed, but no neceſſity that any hand ſhould keep him down, or caſt him lower: in like manner, to the raiſing of any part of that depraved Lump, it was abſolutely neceſſary Gods Divine aſſiſtance ſhould put to its ſaving hand; and theſe are ſaid to be ordained, eſpecially to Grace and Life: but ſuſpending only, and denying the like grace and favour to others, he is ſaid ſometimes to ordain to death and ſin, ſuch; though ſpeaking ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it be no more than not ordaining to the contrary.

                        </note> place writeth thus. <hi>He that may help one that is ready to periſh, and doth not help him, he ſlayes him.</hi> And if God may be ſaid actually to deſtroy ſuch, by withdrawing, or with-holding his ſaving Grace, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his favour; may he not be ſaid reaſonably and ſoberly to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſuch to deſtruction, when only he doth not ordain him to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
                     <p>There are two things which may ſeem to croſs this: One that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation may ſeem to fall on God, that he doth not that himſelf (being much more pitiful and good by nature, to his Creatures, than they are to one another) which he requireth, under pain of his diſpleaſure, that men ſhould do to one another; <hi>viz.</hi> relieve in neceſſity. This is no hard matter to anſwer, ſeeing the caſe is quite different; and we know no ſuch law that is or can be upon God to do all the good he can, unto the Creature; as there is upon man to do ſo to his brother. But Man himſelf is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to do a favour to other, whereby dammage ſhould enſue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf: And much leſs, God obliged to ſhew mercy in ſuch manner, that he might ſuffer in his Juſtice, or dominion over his creature; which are more conſpicuous; yea and his Mercy too, as to the Degree, though not extent of it, in adjudging ſome to their demerits, while he reſcues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the like miſery.</p>
                     <p>The other objection, which is principally <hi>Calvines</hi> above touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, That by this God ſhould act unreaſonably, not propounding a certain end to himſelf, if he did not directly deſign the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Creature; but, as we have ſaid, indirectly and obliquely: as if God had in ſome Actions no direct and peremptory intention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this doth not follow. For no doubt but God had a direct and poſitive end in creating every particular thing, and eſpecially man: And that intention was agreeable altogether to his own Nature, and his own Works, which were all good, good to both one, and other. And to glorifie man, and be glorified by him, in giving him immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and life, and that without exception; but yet not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: which condition being on mans part violated; What hinders but Gods ſecondary end and intention ſhould be to return the fruits of mans doings upon himſelf, and that without exception? For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> And all were in a ſtate of Deſertion and Reprobation. But what if God pleaſes, ſeeing his Creature fallen to decay, to make it over again in Chriſt Jeſus, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> to himſelf a new, and another end? A man hath a fair, handſome, and well-going horſe: he chooſeth him to himſelf to ride on: but he falls lame, and is turn'd off. He recovers him and puts him to his former uſe and ends: Is here any lightneſs or inconſtancie in the owner? Are not all theſe things very reaſonable? Could there be any ſuch unreaſonableneſs as to make one general and poſitive decree, that, come what will, his horſe ſhall ſerve him to ride on? So undoubtedly, the general Decree, and firſt in nature and order, next to Gods glory, was in the creation of man, that he ſhould ſerve
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55232:168"/>
him to his glory, and to the benefit of himſelf. But Man mutilating himſelf and becoming unſerviceable to God, his Owner, and Maſter, was not the Decree of God very wiſe and juſt ordaining him to be a caſt-a-way, ſo long as he continued in that ſtate? And then recovering him by the Mediation of Chriſt, to ordain as many as took their cure, to life everlaſting, and glory: and thoſe who were incurable, or not cured, to everlaſting death: this latter is plainly attributed to God by St. <hi>Jude,</hi> telling us of ſome, <hi>who were before ordained to condemnation:</hi> that is, in the ſenſe even now<note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> explained, given over to condemnation by God: If we may make humane methods of any uſe to us in arriving at the knowledge of Gods proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (as hath been generally received) why may we not judge thus of Gods order of Cauſes? Eſpecially having the conſent of the Scripture, which thus ſpeaks frequently, according to the ſeveral occaſions given? And if it be ſaid to be abſurd, thus to judge of God, as unſetled in his knowledge and judgment, and being regulated by emergencies, We can well anſwer, as in other points of <hi>Anthropapathie,</hi> or Gods complyance with Mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in ſpeaking after humane manner. And if God condeſcends, on purpoſe, that we ſhould underſtand ſomething of him to our edification, ſhall we tranſcend unneceſſarily the limits of modeſty, and content our ſelves with no other order, or leſs knowledge than God himſelf hath of himſelf and wayes? Gods acts, ſeveral in reſpect of us, may be ſimple in reſpect of himſelf, and one: but denominated and diſcriminated variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the divers habitude of the Object. The ſimple eternal Will and Law of God is this, that the Righteous ſhall be ſaved, and the Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous damned: This is his Predeſtination in general of all mankind: ſubordinate to this, are the ſeveral intermediate changes, the firſt being immutable. And it concerneth not to enquire, What kind of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs this is, or whence, or how man comes by it? Whether he hath it as original Juſtice given him immediately of God at his firſt inſtitution? or whether he hath it ſuperadded and derived from Chriſt? This is certain which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous, even as he is</hi>

                     <p>The anſwer to this doth require that we be firſt ſatisfied in theſe three things, Predeſtination, Election, and Vocation, and the importance of them: and principally to note in order hereunto, that however later Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours (eſpecially from St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time downward) have invented, and that uſefully and reaſonably enough, ſeveral ſignifications and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of them, which are not to be neglected; yet the Scriptures uſe them promiſcuouſly: as may be ſeen from theſe inſtances; amongſt many, <hi>Epheſians</hi> the firſt, the fourth and fifth, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>According as he hath choſen,</hi> i. e.

For firſt, <hi>Predeſtination</hi> or Fore-ordination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture it ſelf, will admit of a contrary object; And there is a Predeſtination to Evil as well as to Good, but in a different ſenſe. For as we have ſhown, when God is ſaid to ordain to Evil, it muſt be rather underſtood in the Negative ſenſe, when he ordains not to Good, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers over men to the commiſſion of ſin. But <hi>Election</hi> is alwayes in a good ſenſe, as is alſo <hi>Vocation:</hi> and are but ſo many progreſſions of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the ſalvation of the Faithful: and not ſpecifically diſtinct <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> or kinds of acts: as doth appear from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> accurate uſe, and<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 25, 30</note> placing of them in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans. Whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to—Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them be alſo glorified.</hi> Where the Apoſtle explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of Gods proceeding in the ſaving of man, makes a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tearms expreſſing it. For here <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> is not that ſimple Intuition whereby he knows all things, but that effectual knowledg, founded on a precedent Decree; which is the ſame with Predeſtination, as now commonly uſed. And that Predeſtination here is the ſame with Election, is probable from that it is added <hi>to be conformed to the image of his Son:</hi> and <hi>Calling</hi> is actuating of that Election and Predeſtination. So that Predeſtination is alwayes underſtood as an act of Gods counſel; and <hi>Election</hi> (when taken properly as diſtinct from that) is an act outward, whereby it pleaſeth God to take to his ſpecial favour, certain perſons, and paſs over others: And <hi>Vocation</hi> ſeemeth to be nothing elſe ſtrictly taken, than that outward means, or miniſtry whereby ſuch are choſen to God: As a man firſt propounds ſeveral objects to himſelf, next he pitches upon one, and determines to take it; thirdly he actually makes choice of the ſame, by ſome ſpecial ſignal of his will. And this God commonly doing by word of mouth, calling him to him, hath given ground to that form of ſpeech in Scripture of being <hi>called,</hi> and <hi>calling:</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication and miniſtration of the Goſpel of Grace being that word of Gods mouth, by which a man is ſelected from the rout and refuſe of the World, to the means of Grace, Juſtification, and Glory. This I take to be the ſimpleſt and ſobereſt ſtate of this perplexed myſtery: In which I ſuppoſe it neceſſary to be adviſed how we ſtick too religiouſly to the tearms <hi>Predeſtination, Election,</hi> and <hi>Vocation,</hi> becauſe of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſignification in Scripture: which muſt needs confound an immutable adherer to any one ſenſe preciſely: and that ſuch words muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood rather from the relation they have one to another, and the matter treated of, as alſo the occaſions, than according to any ſimple ſound of them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore to return to the Queſtion moved concerning Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as an effect, or cauſe of Predeſtination, Election, and Vocation, it muſt be anſwered from the diſtinct conſideration of theſe tearms. For when all theſe (as ſometimes) are Synonymous, and the ſame with that

Pre-determination of Almighty God to Grace (For there is a Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Election and Vocation to Grace, as the means, as well as to Glory, the End,) then it can be, in no tolerable ſenſe, ſaid, That grace is the cauſe of ſuch ſpecial acts of God.

                        <hi>there can be no poſſible way of meriting without Grace, for Grace is the firſt Principle or beginning of all merit:</hi> and nothing can be a cauſe, or ſo much as conduce to its own being: But the inclining of God to ſuch a thing muſt come under the notion of meriting, or to ſpeak more agreeably to our ears, <hi>doing well before God.</hi> And therefore they much more truly may be ſaid to be the direct cauſe of Grace. And this not as ſome Pelagian Hereticks ſuppoſed, at laſt by conſtraint of argument; for the more ready and eaſie operation of mans will; but ſimply to will that which is good. Nay St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, and that truly, the ſame of mans Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,<note place="margin">

                     <p>But there is another and farther tearm of Gods Predeſtination, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Vocation, which is to his Kingdome of Glory, and the Reward not of the merit, but work of Faith and Holineſs. And to theſe no doubt, but we are ordained and elected, and called as the end, by thoſe means. This is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> intended in that place to the Romans above quoted: and in the ſecond chapter; telling us, God <hi>will render to every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                        <hi>his Kingdom, ſhall be given to them, for whom it is prepared:</hi> and in the <hi>25th,</hi> who they are for whom it is ſo prepared, from the foundation of the world; <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteous; and moreover, who are the Righteous: namely, ſuch who abounded in good works there particularly mentioned. And to this may be referred moſt of thoſe ſpeeches at large, falling from the moſt eminent Fathers of the Church, before the time of <hi>Auſtine;</hi> wherein they affirm, that God elected ſome and not others, upon the fore-ſight of good works in them, and obedience; others rejecting for their diſobedience. Thus ſpake <hi>Origen,</hi> thus <hi>Chryſoſtome, Nazianzene, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> too, who wrote as expreſly as <hi>Auſtine,</hi> againſt ſuch a freedom of the will which ſhould give any occaſion to God to confer his firſt Grace on man; all mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than the election of man to glory, upon the intuition of Grace. Now if this opinion ſhould be ſtrained to the higheſt, it would not riſe to this, that God did chooſe any man ſimply and primarily for his works ſake, or his faith fore-ſeen; for, as is ſhewed, God elected ſimply to that, and not for that: but the moſt may be wrung out of it, is too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity to Merit: But neither doth this follow; ſeeing they, who ſay, God in ſuch an order, <hi>i. e.</hi> after grace, &amp; upon ſuch an occaſion, as thoſe good works of which God is no leſs a principle cauſe than Man, doth chooſe to confer glory on a man, or ordain him to life, do not ſay, that ſuch fore-ſeen works bear a proportion to ſuch glory or reward. The Scriptures, which plainly
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55232:169"/>
affirms the former, exclude the latter, making it a matter of free promiſe in the original, and the gift of God, together with mans work; as eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the <hi>Romans</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth; <hi>Now being made free from ſin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22, 23.</note> 
                        <hi>ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life. For the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There is nothing therefore more conſonant to reaſon, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better reconciles the ſeeming jarrs of the ancient Fathers before, and about the time of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> with that more wary and exact ſtate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Queſtion concerning Gods election of man, upon pre-viſion of Faith and Obedience, (alwayes including Chriſts obedience and merits) and the freeneſs of his Grace in electing. And nothing reconciles the Scriptures more clearly, than the opinion which allows God to be the ſole reaſon of his own will, and the author of his Grace of Sanctification and Salvation alſo; and yet holdeth ſuch an order between theſe, that God doth not chooſe any man to his free and immerited Grace of Salvation, but through and upon conſideration (I do not ſay, valuable and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in weight and worth, but in nature) of the ſtate of Sanctification, going before. Does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> render it as a reaſon, why God was to be glorified in his Saints, when he came to take vengeance of his adverſaries; <hi>Becauſe our teſtimony among you was believed?</hi> And did not the Maſter of<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 10.

Doth not St. <hi>James</hi> ſay the very<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 12.</note> ſame, in theſe words? <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptations, for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of life, which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that love him.</hi> Surely, that which man promiſeth upon a condition, he doth not ordinarily beſtow, before that condition be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but ordains it to follow upon it. And to the ſame purpoſe ſpeaks St. <hi>John</hi> too in the <hi>Apocalypſe, Be thou faithful unto death, and I will</hi>

                     <p>But perhaps they think, there remains ſome force in <hi>Calvins</hi> argument, ſtill, againſt this; and that God muſt be obnoxious to that imprudence, that ordinary men are not, if he did not firſt propound the end, and then make all means to conform, and conduce to it; ſo that man ſhould firſt be ordian'd to his end of glory or miſery, before he is. All this I grant, and yet grant them nothing; and this is all they are like to get, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the inward and ſecret acts of God, with his outward, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, with the execution of them; as <hi>Twiſs</hi> notoriouſly doth, in<note place="margin">

                     <p>The ſumme of what I am to ſay, is this, That, Firſt, Gods Providence ordaineth that man ſhall be, and then ordaineth that he ſhall be of ſuch a condition, and to ſuch an end; and then he giveth him an actual Being; and then according to the ſtate he is found in, brings him to his proper end; and not in that unnatural, prepoſterous, and irrational method, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines him abſolutely to an end, before he determines his Being at all. And thoſe places of Scripture alledged to defend this preſumption, do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overthrow it; as that amongſt others, <hi>The children being not yet born,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth; It was ſaid unto her,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55232:170"/>
The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> I readily here grant a parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods electing to ſpiritual and temporal ends, which this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuppoſeth; but I do not grant, That it was Gods purpoſe, that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, before it was his purpoſe that they both ſhould be; or that the execution of this Decree did not depend upon the execution of means leading unto it. So that, when it is ſaid, <hi>God firſt,</hi> as man, <hi>ordains the end, and then the means conducing unto it;</hi> it is true only, when it relates to the end of the <hi>Ordainer,</hi> not of the thing <hi>ordained,</hi> which hath its end really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that general one. Man propoundeth to himſelf profit, and then ordains ſome proper means tending to it: He purpoſes to make a Statue, and then purpoſes to make him a Tool proper to that piece of work. He purpoſes indeed firſt that ſuch work ſhall be done by a Tool, but he doth not purpoſe that this individual Tool ſhall do it, before it hath a Being: So God firſt purpoſeth his Glory, as the ultimate end; next, he decreeth that man ſhall contribute to that end, in the ſeveral methods of accompliſhing it; but he doth not purpoſe, that any individual man, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſhall proceed this way, or that way, before he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a purpoſe to give them a Being. And thus farre of the firſt part of Gods Providence, in ordaining acts of Grace and Mercy.</p>

But here we are to conſider the manner and reaſon of Gods ſeverity towards his Creature, in theſe two formidable acts of his juſt Providence.</p>
                     <p>Before we can make any tolerable deſcription of which, it will be very neceſſary to diſtinguiſh them. For the total neglect hereof, (as with the author of <hi>Gods Love to Mankind,</hi> in the very entrance of his Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding miſerably theſe two) or the miſtake in the due diviſion, which error <hi>Petavius</hi> falls into, where he tells us, Divines are commonly wont<note place="margin">Petavius <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. Theolog. l. 9. c. 9. To.</hi> 1.</note> to make a two fold Reprobation; <hi>One, negative, as they call it, (which is as much as Praeterition</hi>) or, not electing—The other, <hi>Reprobation, is Poſitive, whereby he not only paſſes by thoſe perſons, and relinquiſhes them, but alſo adjudges them to eternal puniſhment.</hi> And this diſpleaſes him ſo far, as to the ground of it, that he ſtrains hard by the help of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to make this a branch of <hi>Marcions</hi> Hereſie, but in vain; for the things are in themſelves really and worthily by many learned Divines, diſtinguiſhed; but who are they that bungle ſo in the framing of ſuch a diſtinction, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he no more can, than he doth tell. Reprobation we do indeed make Poſitive and Negative, but we make Damnation none of them; for we may diſtinguiſh a two-fold act in God and in Man, the one oppoſed to good, wanting in the object to be choſen, and that may be called, <hi>Reprobation,</hi> or refuſal Negative, which refuſes the object either upon meer abſolute pleaſure, or ſome ſuch abſence or want of good, which might make it eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. The other is more Poſitive, when there is found ſomewhat in the object, which addeth unto the want of good, the preſence of evil oppoſite and odious unto the chooſer. Now taking Reprobation, as it is oppoſed to Predeſtination (as ſome do) then, as they ſay, Predeſtination ſuppoſeth nothing in the object to move God to ordain a thing ſimply, or reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to ſuch an end. So may it be ſaid of Reprobation, that it neceſſarily ſuppoſes nothing in the object, cauſing God to turn from it; whereupon <hi>Picus Mirandola</hi> determines thus, according to <hi>Thomas: A reaſon may be</hi>

                        <hi>given from the divine goodneſs, of the Predeſtination of ſome, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others; and the divine will is the</hi> only <hi>reaſon, that thoſe he rejects, and chooſes others unto glory.</hi> This may well be allowed, from the ſupream and abſolute dominion of G d over all things, ſo far eſpecially as may amount to a denial of beatitude to the Creature capable of it, and a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of not only the Grace, but common influence of God from the Creature, upon which it ſhould return, from whence it came to nothing. But it grates hard upon the natural goodneſs of God, to affirm, that the divine will ſhould indulge ſo much to its abſolute Soveraignty, as, no cauſe preceding, to conceive an hatred or indignation againſt the work of its own hands, as to ſentence it directly to everlaſting, or indeed momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pains; ſeeing God cannot be unjuſt, or properly cruel one moment, any more than he can be eternally. Neither can he unreaſonably afflict the body, or damnifie a man in his eſtate, any more than he can puniſh the ſoul in Hell. Of all theſe therefore, the Queſtion is but one, What ground can be aſſigned of Gods pleaſure, or rather diſpleaſure herein?</p>
                     <p>To this therefore according to the diſtinction mentioned, anſwer may be: That of the negative will of God, ſeen in Preterition, or not electing ſome to ſome high ends, (which we alſo call here negative Reprobation) no reaſon can be given, or ought to be ſought, out of Gods divine will, as <hi>Picus</hi> hath rightly determined. But as commonly it is ſeen, when the Maſter of the Family is gone out, the houſe falls into diſorder, and ſo finding it, he ſentences his ſervants to their ſeveral puniſhments, or may turn them out of doors: So God having the liberty to depart from his Creature, at his pleaſure, in this way of Preterition, whether Supralapſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or Sublapſarian, there doth, upon that, ſpring up from it, evil, and diſorder in the ſoul, contrary to Gods will revealed, which he refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon, may ſafely and juſtly decree to entertain it in his favour no longer, but reprobating it, adjudge it to the puniſhment deſerved. God doth not therefore primarily (as ſome have boldly delivered) propound to himſelf the poſitive pains and ruine of any Creature, no inducement, no grounds going before, but he may very well in a negative ſenſe, be ſaid to reprobate it, not affording thoſe preſervatives needfull to its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                     <p>This doth ſufficiently appear, in the firſt act of his Reprobation of men and Angels, whom, without all doubt, he could have preſerved in their original ſtate; but he freely refuſed, and they both freely choſe to leave him, and expoſe themſelves to his ſevereſt judgement, which was by this poſitive Reprobation, to bring them under the effects of their ſins, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So that they who deny any cauſe out of God, of his firſt Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, do not deny a cauſe ſufficient of his ſecond, and poſitive; but the Devils, and thoſe men as are ſignaliz'd <hi>Reprobates,</hi> are undoubtedly the free and full authors of Gods reprobating them, and condemning them in this manner. Of the <hi>Angels,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeak expreſly, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4.</note> their offences, a reaſon why God proceeded ſo againſt them, and not the ſimple will of him. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and delivered them to chains of darkneſs, to be reſerved unto judgment.</hi> And the ſame is repeated by St. <hi>Jude.</hi> And when God ſaith<note place="margin">Jude 6. Gen. 2. 17.</note> in hie Covenant with <hi>Adam, In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55232:171"/>
dye:</hi> he implyeth the reaſon of his Decree to puniſhment, to be ſin. And when the Wiſe man exhorteth ſaying, <hi>Seek not death in the error of your life,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wiſd. 1. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>and pull not upon your ſelves deſtruction with your own hands:</hi> he doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply a direct cauſe in Man of his own ruine. And the words<note place="margin">13.</note> following exempt God from any hand in ſuch things, as the Author. <hi>For God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>made not death, neither hath he pleaſure in the deſtruction of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> And here come in that, in its due place, though it were not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſpiritual or eternal deſtruction, <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> For though without any ſuppoſition taken from the Creature, God may paſs him over, and deny him grace and glory, yet doth he not deſign any man directly to damnation, but upon ſuppoſition of ſin going before.</p>
                     <p>And from this ſtate of things, may competent reconciliation be made to the ſeeming oppoſitions of Scripture, and to <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> himſelf.

and hard-heartedneſs in them. But the incapacity of Grace and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Salvation, are meant by the latter Texts, proceeding from the ſole Preterition of God, refuſing to prevent the evil and malignity of mens wills, which for want of that preventing Grace do certainly tend to evil, and are incurable of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But upon this I ſee divers ſhrewd Objections to ariſe; as, Firſt, That by this with-holding of Gods Grace, his Preterition, there is brought a neceſſity upon mans will to evil, and his indifferency to life and death quite taken away, as all uſe of the means of Grace.</p>
                     <p>To this we have in good degree anſwered before, and there ſhewed, how that the fore-knowledge in God of mans fixed eſtate, whether by his own will electing, as they ſay, freely, or Gods will determining, (which fore-knowledge is yielded to God by theſe Objectors) doth oblige them, as well as me, to ſhew what profit it would be to man, to move or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards Grace and Life, when he is already determined; only this is the difference between them: The one ſeems to hold, That God by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent act drives the nail, whereby man is immoveably faſtned to one thing; and the other holds, That by a ſubſequent act of knowledge, he clincheth it, which man himſelf drove, ſo that it can never ſtir.

                     <p>I find in a very grave and learned Author, a diſtinction which I find no where elſe, deſigned to eaſe this doubt, between <hi>Inevitable</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> which in truth are not diſtinct; and therefore he is conſtrained contrary to the agreed way of ſpeech, to make <hi>Infallible</hi> the ſame with Neceſſary, whereas the diſtinction is between Neceſſity and Infallibility, or Inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is the very ſame: For what is infallible, but that whoſe act or object ſhall have a certain event; and this event not to be avoided or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, is called, Inevitable.

But if this yet doth not abſolutely ſatisfie, as I know, it doth not ſome, becauſe, ſay they, it is to delude man to offer that and exhort to that, which it is impoſsible to attain to; (ſo that though God by his abſolute and divine Prerogative, might have deſerted man, yet it ſtands not with his natural equity or ſimplicity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Creature, to exhort and threaten, when there is ſuch inevitable neceſſity upon him, and condemn him for not doing that, which he knows he cannot do without him, refuſing effectually to aſſiſt him.) I anſwer, It might very well call in queſtion, the fair dealing of God towards his Creature, if ſo be he ſhould make an act for him, after he was diſabled to obſerve and perform the ſame, not aſſiſting him to the performance of his will. But God doth not ſo; for though the Command ſtands in force againſt him, yet it was not prepared for him in his deſtitute condition; and no reaſon, that Gods right of ruling ſhould change with the vanity of the Creature. It ſuffices, that once it was proportionable to him, and that the impotency now pleaded is owing to himſelf, and that Gods Laws now are rather recited and propounded to him, than made for him, in the condition he is in. But ſecondly, Gods Commands indeed though but urged anew, ſhould be ludicrous and in vain, did they totally miſs of their ends, in being thus repeated and inculcated, if they had no ſucceſs.

For how many things elſe might we accuſe God and Nature for ſending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>us, when they do no good at all, that we can perceive, but rather miſchiefs? As deluges of waters in a wet time; and in droughts, great ſhowers of rain, emptying themſelves into the Sea, or ſandy deſerts, from whence nothing ſprings anſwerable to ſuch divine bounty? But we are taught, that God and Nature made things and ordained them in <hi>their kind,</hi> uſeful for the Univerſe, and never by a particular purpoſe, that every ſingle act or part ſhould have the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and proportionable effect, that the whole hath. And ſo in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of his ſpiritual Graces, it ſuffices to acquit and juſtifie divine providence, that they have their due ends, though not the ſame that man may expect, who certainly would never have it rain (might he order matters and chooſe) but at ſuch times, and in ſuch places, as he thinks fit, and then, alwayes. Again, It would go harder againſt this opinion, if ſo be that the only end why God publiſhed his Word, and gave his Laws, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is indeed a principal, but not the only intent God hath, but the publication of Gods holineſs, and juſtice, and righteouſneſs, and mercy, and the like glorious attributes, in which publication God is much more known, admired, and glorified by wicked men, and reprobates, than otherwiſe, though they oppoſe and diſlike the ſame, even againſt their own wills, giving ſuch like glory to God on earth, as they ſhall in Hell hereafter: And we know, that no acceſsion of real good being poſsible to be made to God, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manifeſtation is of principal concernment. Laſt of all, Could there be an infallible diſcriminating note, made between the incorrigible repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates deſtined to deſtruction, and the corrigible offender ordained to life,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55232:173"/>
then indeed much more colour would appear, to juſtifie the refuſal of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing the means of ſalvation to ſuch, and the denial in the reprobate, to give ear to ſuch offers; but fleſh and bloud cannot reveal this to us, and the Spirit of God hath not. Doth not God ſend his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> with<note place="margin">Ezek. 3. 4. 7.</note> expreſs commiſſion to warn the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though he expreſly aſſures him, <hi>They will not hearken unto thee, for they will not hearken unto me.</hi> If the child in the womb, being certainly determin'd to one ſex long before it is brought forth, yet this certainty being hid from our eyes, (though but for ſuch a ſmall time) is thought by Parents a matter of prayer many times, that it may be a Son: How ſhould not we much rather, take the juſt occaſion of applying our ſelves to acts of Religion, though poſſibly the event with God is determined? The ſumme then of this Chapter comes to this; That God by his ſoveraign dominion, and by his inſcrutable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, doth, out of the corrupted and forlorn maſs of fallen man, elect whom he pleaſes, to effectual Grace, and from thence brings them to infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glory, but never without their own acts of embracing his offers, and perſevering faithfully in his ſervice. So that though he purely chooſes them to the means of Grace, without conſideration of their worth or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, yet he never ordains any, or elects them to Glory, but upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition of faith, and obedience to his will. And on the other ſide, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by others, leaving them in great part as he found them, from whence ſpring works of wickedneſs, freely invented and acted, and tending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly unto damnation. So that God doth not in like manner influence the wicked, as he doth the righteous, that is, for no other cauſe but his own will, taking occaſion juſtly from that common deformity, wherein he finds them, but never ſimply deſtinates any man to damnation, but upon beholding the deſerts of their ſins. But how it can come to paſs, that God thus ordaining the end, damnation, ſhould not alſo appoint the means, ſin, without which he condemns no man, ſhall be anſwered in a more proper place. Here only I add, for their ſakes, who meaſure opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by famous Patrons, to which they are addicted, that as I have ſaid nothing to comply with, or ſpitefully to oppoſe <hi>Calvin</hi> and his followers, ſo neither to croſs <hi>Arminius:</hi> But this I muſt ſay, that though I look upon <hi>Arminius</hi> as a much more modeſt man, and more judicious Diſputant than <hi>Calvin,</hi> in theſe deep points; yet in their followers, we ſhall eaſily ſee a great diſparity, to the diſadvantage of the Remonſtrants: For very many of <hi>Calvins</hi> followers have mitigated, and fairly interpreted his too harſh and ſcandalous expreſſions and opinions, and I think, none have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him. But on the other ſide, what <hi>Arminius</hi> with much modeſty and gravity delivered erroneouſly, his abettors and followers have purſued and improved, many of them, to ſuch an intollerable height, that they fall often into direct Pelagianiſm, and from thence, which is much worſe, into Socinianiſin, as experience plainly ſheweth.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> The Occaſion of treating of Sin here. What ſin is. What Evil. Monſtrouſneſs in things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and Evil in Moral things illuſtrate each other. Sin no poſitive or real Thing. God the direct Cauſe of Evil. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Romans makes nothing for the contra—Remonſtrants literally and primarily taken.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE near reſpect that Sin hath to what is paſſed, and the aſpect it hath to what is before us, concerning the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in the Fall of Man from his native Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, oblige us here to enquire farther into the nature of it. And ſlightly paſſing over that doubt of ſome Philoſophers and Ancient Hereticks, How, if there were a God, who is ſupreamly and infinitely good, and no more but one, Evil ſhould find any being amongſt the beautiful works of God, its nature being ſo foul, monſtrous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God? becauſe it is touched above, and in truth do adde rather a greater beauty and luſtre to God works than if no ſuch thing were to be found, and becauſe as the glory, ſo the power of God is much more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thereby, in that he curbs and checks its exceſs and exorbitancie, at his pleaſure, and forces it by his providence to a good event in general, if not particular; we are now to ſatisfie our ſelves, What that we call E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Sin, is: And what relation God hath to it?</p>
                     <p>Firſt then we are to note that <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> differ only as <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> ſo that all Sin is Evil, but all Evil is not Sin. Evil is that which is contrary to nature or natural Good. Sin is that which is contrary to grace and moral good. And that which is contrary to the order, rule, and form of Nature is called Monſtrous; that which is contrary to the Rule of Juſtice and Holineſs, is called <hi>Sin.</hi> And as monſtroſity in nature is divided into defects and exceſſes: So Sin in morality is divided into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Commiſſions. And of neither of theſe can God be ſaid to be the Authour; or Nature under him: For if Nature, according to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which is but Gods Inſtrument, doth not intend monſtrous effects, much leſs may God be ſaid ſo to do, whoſe acts are alwayes more conſtant and ſteady, the higher they are, and nearer to himſelf. For (to give an inſtance) when we ſee a want of a limb in a monſtrous birth, it may ſo far be imputed to Divine Providence, that it could not ſo happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge and conſent of the Supream Cauſe in whoſe power it was to have diſpoſed outward and ſecond cauſes to the effecting of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and perfect work: yet directly, and with a poſitive purpoſe to have aſſiſted in the production of ſuch a Monſter, we cannot ſafely nor wiſely
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55232:174"/>
ſay, ſeeing the denyal of that ordinary and more neceſſary concurrence to ſuch an end is altogether ſufficient to it: and ſuch defects ariſe not from Gods poſitive Will to have them ſo, but from his not willing to have them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                     <p>There may ſeem ſomewhat more difficulty in Monſters in exceſs, when any Creatures have more parts than are naturally proper to them, as four hands, or three leggs, and the like: But this proves not any direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to this, but only an intention not to keep things in their proper limits, and to their Rule. A Maſter or Father when he holds not a ſevere hand over his child or ſervant, cannot but by inference and conſequence, be ſaid to be the cauſe of the exorbitant carriages of them; becauſe though he wills not to prevent ſuch miſchiefs, he doth not will they ſhould be. God in like manner willeth redundance of matter, as a thing real and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but that it ſhould meet together as to conſtitute ſuch an unnatural effect, is rather the ſuſpence and with-holding his Providence then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>This I premiſe as leading to the due apprehenſion of Moral Evil: which to hold as ſuch to have a poſitive Exiſtence in the world, is inevitably to become Manichean, and to make God the Authour of ſin: as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in theſe words declareth. Here we are to be careful that we fall not into the Heriſee of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who ſaid there was a certain <hi>Nature of Evil, and a certain people of darkneſs with their Princes:</hi> And afterward; <hi>So they erre, ſo they are blinded, ſo they make themſelves the people [Gentem Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrarum] of darkneſs, by believing that which is falſe, againſt him who created them, for every Creature is good, but it is corrupted by the depraved will of Man.</hi> Thus he: and were it ſo that Evil had a poſitive being, from whom could it proceed but from God? And it is repugnant to the Nature of the good God to be the Author of any thing ſimply Evil, ſo far the <hi>Manicheans</hi> were in the right: therefore they that hold this, muſt with the <hi>Manichees</hi> invent and introduce another God. I know the modern defenders of the poſitive nature of ſin alledge ſeveral School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſome Fathers, for the ſame: but I know there are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs teſtimonies of the Ancient againſt it, and the Modern of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count had either another ſenſe than we now ſtate the doubt in, or muſt be rejected with their Relater: It is not a place here to examine and encounter all: nor to alledge the Reaſons or Authorities to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which might eaſily be done. Only that Argument taken from the diſtinction of Sins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, deſerves to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. For, ſay they, if Sins of Omiſſion conſiſt only in defect of duty, and are thereby diſtinguiſhed from of Commiſſion (which are ſuch as not only fall ſhort of what is due, but act the quite contrary, as when a man inſtead of praying, and praiſing God contumeliouſly abuſes his Name and Worſhip) this hath more in it than a meer negation or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good. Thus indeed it ſeems, but thus it is not. For both theſe are evil upon the account of privation and the abſence of good: the difference only is in this, that in ſins of Omiſſion, the privativeneſs or negation is immediately ſeated in the Subject owing ſuch an Act, and in ſuch a manner; and here, in no Action at all, but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it, which renders a man and denominates him immediately evil, or defective. But in ſins of Commiſſion, the caſe is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for here privation or defect relateth not immediately to the Subject, as the Man himſelf, but to the Action it ſelf; and by that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55232:175"/>
is the Man made guilty, and evil: becauſe though the act be in its nature poſitive, yet is defective as to its circumſtances; according to which it ought to be performed. For when God hath appointed, and Juſtice and Reaſon directeth that a man ſhould obſerve in his action ſuch a time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſuch a place, and have reſpect to ſuch a perſon, ſuch a manner, and meaſure; and he neglecteth all, or any of theſe, doth he not plainly offend in the negative, though the act it ſelf be in nature poſitive? But in the caſe we are about, the Nature (as we ſaid) of things is not to be valued, but the Morality: and the Morality may be evil, when the Nature is good: and the Morality may be privative, when the Act is poſitive. Hatred of God is an act of Man, than which none can be inſtanced in, to contain more evil or malice. Therefore as this is an act Natural and Vital, it is good, and hath God for its direct and firſt cauſe; but as this act is directed to God, and ſo relates to a wrong object, ſo it is evil, and hath neither countenance nor concurrence from him.

                     <p>I might here ſet down the opinions and teſtimonies of diverſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Fathers expreſly declaring againſt the poſitive nature of ſin: but I ſhall rather compoſe the diſputation, by giving <hi>Anſelmes</hi> judgment of the caſe, than whom none have diſputed the matter more acutely, of his Age. In his eleventh Chapter of his Dialogue concerning the fall of the Devil, he asks, <hi>How Nothing and Evil ſhould ſignifie any thing; whereas Evil is altogether Privative:</hi> and there he anſwers, <hi>Although Evil and Nihil ſignifieth ſomething; yet that which is ſignified, is not Evil or Nothing; but ſome other manner whereby they ſignifie ſomething. And that which is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is ſomewhat, but yet not really ſomewhat, but, as it were ſomewhat. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are ſpoken after a certain form, which are not in very deed. And to fear, according to the form of the word, doth ſignifie ſomewhat Active, when as it is Paſſive according to the thing it ſelf. And ſo Blindneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the <hi>26th</hi> Chapter of that Treatiſe he ſpeaketh thus; <hi>Evil which is called unrighteouſneſs is alwayes, Nothing: But Evil which is Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſometimes without doubt, is Nothing, as Blindneſs.</hi> Aliquando eſt aliquid, <hi>Sometimes is ſomething, as Sadneſs and Pain.</hi> And Chapter the <hi>27th;</hi> He gives <hi>the general</hi> reaſon why Evil cannot be Any thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe if it were any thing, it muſt <hi>be of God.</hi> Thus he: who we ſee diſtinguiſheth Evil, firſt into that of ſin, and that of puniſhment, or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditas,</hi> as he calls it. And that of puniſhment he again diſtinguiſhes into meerly <hi>Privative,</hi> as blindneſs: and <hi>Poſitive,</hi> which is in ſuffering<note place="margin">

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55232:175"/>
And we may eaſily yield that all Evil of Puniſhment is poſitive, though it be not, and yet retain our opinion, which runs only upon the Evil of Sin. I know <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> than whom it is well known no man ſpeaks more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the privative nature of all Sin, and <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Cajetane,</hi> and others are alledged to have aſſerted a real Being of Concupiſcence in man, which undoubtedly is Sin. But they may be interpreted, according to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ground, where we allowed all ſins to have a ſubject in which they are, and when this ſubject is ſomewhat active and poſitive, as ſuch acts of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Concupiſcence are, and of our other Paſſions and Affections, then is the Evil of them taking its denominations from its matter to which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, ſaid to be poſitive, for diſtinction ſake, from thoſe ſins we call Sins of Omiſſion.</p>
                     <p>From theſe grounds laid we may now adventure farther into the cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity God may be ſaid to have in reference to the Evil of Sin, for as to that of Puniſhment, the difficulty is not great. There are two Parties in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church which go contrary wayes, making two ſeveral Propoſitions which joyned together do make God directly the Authour of Sin. So that a man may with better Reaſon make it a reaſon againſt communion with the Roman Church, than Companion againſt the Reformed, one of whoſe ten Reaſons againſt the Reformed, that they made God the Authour of ſin: For this, by the confeſſion of ſome of the Romaniſts muſt follow. For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans do directly profeſs, That God doth concurr to the act of Evil, and with the Will not only determined by it ſelf, but determining it ſelf to an evil. On the contrary, The Jeſuits affirm that God awaiting and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the inclination and ſelf-determination of the will, doth not concurr to the very act of ſin, but follows that motion which is evil: adding, and profeſſing as in particular doth <hi>Suarez,</hi> That <hi>if God ſhould firſt, according</hi>

Nay <hi>Medina</hi> goes farther, and of himſelf will do the work before he is aware.

But yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>concurreth not to the deformity of ſin.</hi> Here is a myſtery, if any man could find it out. The deformity of Sin conſiſteth only in the privation of the act, or, which is the very ſame, want of conformity to the Rule of Actions, and the will of God: And yet it is here ſaid, That God may be the Author of the Act, and the Author of the Privation that is found in that act, which Privation is nothing elſe but a want of due conformity, and yet not the Author of the deformity of that Act. This is a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>The true and ſimple account then of this matter may be this, That God is never any direct cauſe of Privations or Deformity of any Act, though he be the true Cauſe of the Act it ſelf. And his <hi>not willing</hi> to prevent by his effectual concurſe, ſuch an Evil in the Act, is all can be imputed unto him, and that is far from being the Cauſe of ſin: unleſs it could be proved that there lay an obligation any time upon God, as many times there does upon

man, That he ſhould exert his Divine power to the utmoſt, for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the miſchiefs he can; and hindring ſin.</p>
                     <p>And here if querulous man (as 'tis often ſeen) doth repiningly reply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for hard dealing towards him, in that he puniſhes him for that ſin which he foreſees cannot be avoided by him, Gods grace withdrawing it ſelf from him: St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands him ſilence, whether he underſtands the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20, 21.</note> or equity of it or not: ſaying, <hi>Nay, but O man, What art thou that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> No man that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges (and every Chriſtian muſt acknowledge) the like, and greater power and prerogative in God over Man, than the Potter hath of his clay; can deny that God may order the work of his hands, as he pleaſes: neither can he deny but the drift of the Apoſtle in this compariſon was to ſhow the abſolute power and dominion of God over all Creatures: and therefore let them ſee how they aggravate matters of this nature, and multiply fond ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations, which they cannot but know agree not with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtating and deciſion of this Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>I do freely grant the adverſe Party, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not at all concern himſelf with that kind of Predeſtination, Election, or Vocation, as very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confidently preſume he doth, in his Eighth and Ninth Chapters to the <hi>Romans:</hi> I mean, not particular or perſonal Prae-determination, and the like: the whole letter and the occaſion of his diſcourſe there, being concerning the Election of the Gentile Church, and the unceſſant protection thereof, againſt all threatnings and Oppoſitions, and diſputing the equity of Gods deſerting the Jewiſh Church: yet thus far his argument, being general, holds good in particular perſons; that if it be free to God, without any juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to chooſe and leave a Church or Nation at his pleaſure, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of his own will, it is alſo reaſonable and juſt for him, to favour, or ſhow disfavour to any ſingle perſon in like acts of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; without being called in queſtion for what he doth, or not doth.</p>

                        </gap> of Man; <hi>viz.</hi> Why God ſhould make ſuch a fine and exquiſite piece, and deliver it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſently to ruin and loſs. It may ſuffice, that God was not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect cauſe of ſuch his Fall, by impelling him, though his Free-will embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Temptation, he was privy to his errour. As it was in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable caſe of the death of <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Kings,</hi> when <hi>Hazael</hi> was ſent to enquire, <hi>Whether he ſhould recover</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Kings 8. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>of that Sickneſs;</hi> The Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> anſwered, <hi>Go ſay unto him, thou mayeſt certainly recover: how be it, the Lord hath ſhewed me, that he ſhall ſurely dye:</hi> And this was the true caſe of Adam; whom God knew to have full power certainly to ſtand, and yet he knew he would ſurely fall. As therefore God in that caſe, ſpake after the method and manner of mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, ſo he here acted. In that he firſt ſaid the King might ſurely recover, and this was according to the common order of natural Cauſes, which then were upon him in his ſickneſs: which were ſuch as were eaſily reſiſted, and like to have no ſuch effect: But then God withal beholding that which was not ſeen of man (perhaps not thought on by the Actour himſelf, at that time) he ſaw withal a neceſſary dependencie and connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between another cauſe, and that effect which followed; and ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſurely, the contrary to the other. In like manner, God beholding <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in that integrity and vigour of gifts and Graces with which he had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him, ſaw him in a certain condition to perſevere in that ſtate; but ſeeing withal the future outward cauſe of Temptation, he might well ſee the effect, what it would be infallibly. So that, when we ſay, a thing is contingent, we cannot ſay ſo in reſpect of all cauſes, but in reſpect of ſome ſpecial cauſe, to which, in our opinion and obſervation, ſuch an effect may ſeem properly to belong. For it is a true Axiome amongſt Logicians, <hi>All cauſes accidental, are reducible to proper and direct cauſes.</hi> So that there was no neceſſity, by Gods appointment, of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, as he was framed of God, but ſomewhat might occurr outwardly, which by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55232:177"/>
Gods permiſſion, might have as certain effect upon the will of Man, though Free of it ſelf and indifferent, as had the wet cloath laid by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Kings 8. 15.</note> upon the face of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> this only excepted, That what natures ſimple Act did in this, the will of man combining freely againſt himſelf, with thoſe outward cauſes, ſuffered in that.</p>
                     <p>The thing therefore principally to be here enquired after, is rather about the Nature of this Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Effects thereof. And as to the former, it is to be obſerved, That what was in him an Actual ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in us an Original; and what was free to him to be ſubject to it, or void of it, becomes neceſſary to us, and inevitable. It might be called in ſome ſenſe an Original ſin in him; as it was the firſt in nature and time, he ſtood guilty of; but not as if his Nature was from the beginning ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, as to diſpoſe him unto it. Again, in him, it was of it ſelf purely ſinful, and a tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, upon which followed evil effects; but in us, it ſeems to partake originally of both ſin and puniſhment: but chiefly of this latter. For though they ſpeak truly, in the larger ſenſe, who make three things proper and inſeparable from Sin, <hi>Guilt, Stain,</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> yet reſtraining our ſelves to the true Nation of it; there are theſe two things only eſſential to it. The matter it ſelf which is the evil act committed againſt the Law of God; or which commeth to the ſame, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted contrary to the ſame: And the manner, or formality of it, which conſiſteth in the perverſneſs and pravity of the will, which is ſo eſſential to it, that it both diſtinguiſhes the errours of rational men from them of beaſts and mad-men, and them of the ſame Man, from one another: ſo that what was done voluntarily and freely, differs wholly from that done with incogitancie, ſo not affected (for then the will concurs with it and infects it) and without any intention ſo to do, as to point of moral Goodneſs or Evil. And according to the bent or averſeneſs of the will to evil, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are eſtimated the degrees of evil. But though in <hi>Adam</hi> all theſe things concurred to the heightening of his Actual ſin, yet in thoſe that inherit that evil from him, the ſin muſt needs be much leſs in Nature, and lighter; becauſe of no perſonal concurrence to ſuch deformity. Yet not ſo neither, but that it juſtly is denominated Sin, from the very nature and effects of it. For ſeeing whatever is in the Will, muſt be good or evil, and if the Will be found crooked, perverſe, or averſe to that it ought to incline to, this is contrary to Gods inſtitution and Law, and whence ever this proceeds, from an immediate act of our own, or by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from others, ſeeing it is found in the Will, it muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and conſequently odious to God, and in concluſion ſinful.</p>
                     <p>Again, as the fountain poiſons and corrupts all ſtreams flowing from thence, ſo the Will being thus corrupt, and naturally thus ill inclined, all the other defects, even in his body as well as ſoul, contracted by this fall, are as ſo many deformities in man, which render him deſervedly hated of God; ſeeing ſuch diſparity and unlikeneſs to the worſe, to that which he firſt fram'd. Thirdly, Original ſin in Man hath this more of diſorder in it, that it not only is a corruption of the will, and thereby a deformity and vitioſity in the inferiour parts and faculties, but it is of ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For if this depravation went no farther than that evil born with us, if it ſtand there, and wrought no more evil, the nature of it had been leſs ſinful, and more tolerable; but being of an active nature, and having taken up the chiefeſt room in the ſoul of Man, it diſpoſeth and impelleth to more miſchief, in actual tranſgreſſions. As a Garriſon held by a Rebel
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55232:177"/>
doth not only offend Sacred Majeſty by ſtanding out againſt him it ſelf, but when it finds it ſelf ſtrong enough, and hath opportunity, ſallies out and makes invaſion upon its proper Soveraign, and offers actual and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive violence againſt him: So by this Original Evil firſt poſſeſſing the Soul, doth Concupiſcence ſtir, and act by outward practiſes, contrary to the Law and Will of God. And therefore when St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the corrupters of this Doctrine of Original Corruption, They are born not <hi>properly</hi> but <hi>originally</hi> evil; he no wayes contradicts his own Doctrine, whereby he moſt of all farther explained and maintained this Original ſin, being the firſt that gave the name <hi>Original</hi> to that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in man. For true it is, that that only is called properly <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in perſon committed, and were not ſubject to by nature, as their Poſterity are: becauſe it was the firſt, in reſpect of mankind, as well in order of time, as nature and cauſality. Again, though this be traduced unto us his Off-ſpring, and be the cauſe and fountain of all other ſins actually committed afterward, and for the ſame cauſes may rightly be called <hi>Original:</hi> yet conſidering that this Evil thus vitiating our nature, had no conſent of our perſonal will, we neither underſtood it,. nor any wayes affected it, it cannot be ſo properly called ſin, as others which we act knowingly and willingly our ſelves: For nothing is in ſtrict way a ſin which we do not conſent unto in ſome manner, either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in its remoter cauſes. And this doth yet farther appear, becauſe no man is bound to repent properly of Original ſin: Proper Repentance being an Act contrarying and reverſing, ſo far as in us lyes, ſome evil by us done, and not ſuffered involuntarily: But Original ſin is rather ſuffered than acted by the children of <hi>Adam.</hi> Yet though in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt ſenſe, we cannot be ſaid to repent of Original ſin, we are bound to exerciſe ſome Act of Repentance for the ſame: As grief, and ſorrow of mind and heart for the evil we lye under, Confeſſion and Recognition of our ſad ſtate before God, Imploration of his mercie and favour, to remove the ſame from us, and reſtore us to our priſtine innocencie and integrity. For this, thoſe many places of Scripture deſcribing this Evil, do ſeem to require at our hand.</p>
                     <p>And no where doth the Scripture more fully declare this unto us, than in the Fifth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> which becauſe <hi>Socinus,</hi> and ſuch as plough with his Heifer, and are tickled with his pretty phanſies in eluding the Apoſtles meaning, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant interpretation of the moſt Ancient and Modern Expoſitours, we ſhall more particularly conſider. It is undeniable, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> amplifying the grace of God and benefits unto mankind, even the Gentiles, by Chriſt Jeſus, doth there make a compariſion from the Twelfth verſe to the end of the Chapter, of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> and of the Evil we ſuſtained by the firſt Man, <hi>Adam;</hi> and the benefits we receive by the ſecond Man, Chriſt. To this he ſuppoſes the ground of his Compariſon; which is this, that <hi>By one</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>man Sin entred into the world, and death by Sin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> This is made no more of than that <hi>Adam</hi> being the firſt Man in the world, and ſinning, Sin muſt needs enter firſt into the world by him, if he ſinned firſt; and that death followed upon that ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> But if this be all, how come the effects to exceed the cauſe, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55232:178"/>
death to extend farther than ſin? For it is not only ſaid, that death entred into the world, in ſeizing upon that ſingle Malefactour, <hi>Adam:</hi> but So death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned: where two things are to be noted. Firſt, the note of dependance and conſequence, <hi>So.</hi> For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had meant that <hi>Adam,</hi> by himſelf and only for himſelf, introduced death, wherefore ſerves the tearm <hi>So,</hi> which is a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the manner how death came into the world, upon all perſons: and as much as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Adam</hi> firſt ſinning, and bringing death into the world, ſo it was, that this death fell upon all men, for that all have ſinned. Now, it is certain that all that dye have not ſinned perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: and therefore Secondly, the Note <hi>So</hi> muſt alſo ralate to the Cauſe of that death, which was ſin: and is as much as, <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity alſo ſinned, and became obnoxious to death. For to ſay as ſome eminently learned, and uſeful otherwiſe in their Doctrine of Repentance, <hi>Death paſſed upon all,</hi> i. e. ſay they, <hi>Upon all the whole world, who were drowned in the floud of Divine vengeance: and who did ſin after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of</hi> Adam: is as much as if another Scholia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is this, here (as generally) to lay before the Jewes (to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> principally deſigns his diſcourſe) the imperfection of that Law, which was by <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered unto them, and upon which they ſo confidently reſt, that neither the Law of God written in mens
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55232:178"/>
hearts before <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Law then lately delivered by Chriſt was of any account with them; but <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law muſt carry it from all: Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt be by that, and the Vertue of the Meſſias himſelf depended on that. So that, in effect, they thought nothing ſin but what tranſgreſſed the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues againſt this, ſaying, <hi>For until the Law ſin was in the world: but ſin is not imputed when there is no Law:</hi> which is as much as to have ſaid, Ye ought not ſo much to ſtand upon your Moſaical Law: For that is not the only judge, or tryal of ſin; ſeeing ſin was <hi>in the world until the Law,</hi> that is, all the time from <hi>Adam</hi> to your Law; <hi>but ſin is not imputed when there is no Law:</hi> but ſin was imputed, and puniſhed too. For (v. 14.) <hi>death reigned from Adam to Moſes.</hi> Now if there was ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as death, then ſurely there muſt be a Tranſgreſſion, and if there be ſuch a Tranſgreſſion, there muſt be alſo a Law, which is ſo tranſgreſſed: And therefore if ſuch a Law, then ſurely <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law was not that only Law, nor moſt ancient. Now (to draw nearer to our preſent Caſe) on whom fell this puniſhment of death? the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>On all,</hi> without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Even on them</hi> (which could only be doubted of) <hi>that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion.</hi> What is meant by this? That is, ſaith our Authour, <hi>Who ſinned not ſo capitally. For to ſin like Adam is uſed as a tragical and high expreſſion,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 7. <hi>They like men have ſinned, in the Hebrew it is,</hi> Like Adam. Of this I grant thus much, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was the greateſt that ever was committed ſince, all things duly weighed, and therefore it may well ſtand for a moſt heinous ſin: and therefore <hi>Job</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaith, by way of abhorrence and purgation, <hi>If I covered my ſin as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 31 33.</note> One main circumſtance aggravating <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was, that he would have hid it, as himſelf, out of Gods eyes, and defended himſelf, when he was convinced; but how he repented the Scripture is ſilent. But that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſin cannot be the ground of compariſon, but the very nature of ſin, and kind, is plain from the ſubject thus puniſhed by death. For had they been only men of years, who could chooſe the good, and refuſe the evil, then indeed leſs might have been objected againſt that interpretation: but it being manifeſt that death reigned over Infants alſo who committed no ſin, as did <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore another ſenſe muſt be found, which anſwers the full intent of the Apoſtles argument, and it can be no other than this, That by <hi>ſimilitude</hi> here he means, the like in nature, and not only in degree: For Infants, who are puniſhed with death, have not ſinned as did <hi>Adam: Adams</hi> ſin was a ſin properly ſo called, and Actual: but Children, who dye, ſin not ſo, but are ſubject to that we call Original ſin: which being ſuch a corruption as defaceth the Image of God, and as it were clips his Royal Coyn, and allayes it with baſer mettal than he ordained man to conſiſt of, may cauſe him juſtly to be rejected. Nay, which is much more, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (ſurely unadviſedly, as inconſiſtently with the principles of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> Actual ſin, as in himſelf, was ſuch, that it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the ſons of him before the Floud: For ſayes he, <hi>They indeed in rigour did themſelves deſerve it, but if it had not been for that provocation by</hi> Adam, <hi>they who ſinned not ſo bad, and had not been ſo ſeverely and expreſly threatened, had not ſuffered ſo ſeverely.</hi> This is more than what the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt defenders of Original ſin dare affirm: <hi>viz.</hi> That God ſhould take an occaſion of puniſhing one man for anothers fault, when he did in no manner partake of the ſin. Surely, if nothing of the Offence had deſcended to the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> nothing of the puniſhment ſhould have touched them.</p>

                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:55232:179"/>Next to the compariſon here made by the Apoſtle between acts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and the acts of Chriſt, and the effects and events of one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the compariſon between the perſons to whom theſe on both ſides extended: and ſheweth that the remedy by Chriſt was proportionable altogether to the miſchief occaſioned by <hi>Adam.</hi> For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As by the offenſe of One, judgment came upon All men to condemnation, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of One, the free gift came upon All men unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 18, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>of life. For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> There ſeems in theſe two verſes to be ſome contrariety, in that, firſt it is ſaid that <hi>Judgment came upon all,</hi> and <hi>the Free gift upon all:</hi> and yet afterward, there is a reſtriction unto many, and not all concerned in the ſin. Therefore it is to be obſerved, That, in the firſt place the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſtate of Evil or Condemnation: in the next, of the ſtate of Reſtitution and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: For as all perſons were included in the Condemnation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſo were all included in the Juſtification of Chriſt: But as of all them, only ſome, many were, through his diſobedience, made Sinners: that is, became ſuch ſinners as not to return to actual Righteouſneſs and Salvation, ſo by the obedience of Chriſt, not all who were called and choſen came to Life and Holineſs, but many only were made Righteous actually, and not all. Or if we take the word <hi>Sin</hi> as he, of whom we ſpeak, doth, not ſo much for the real inward vitiouſneſs of the ſoul, but for any outward defect; and, which is yet more, for the Puniſhment of Sin (in which ſenſe the Sacrifice for ſin was called Sin in the Old Law: and Chriſt in the New Teſtament is ſaid to be made Sin for us; that is, a Sacrifice for Sin) ſo that to be <hi>made ſinners,</hi> ſhould import as much as to be made lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the puniſhment of ſin, the matter is the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Authour not only inclines to the Opinion of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and of <hi>Socinus</hi> after him, making the corruption of nature nothing, and therefore exempting Infants from any ſuch natural infection as we here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but uſes the ſame evaſion of Imitation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as the original of all Evil to us; therefore let us hear what St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> argument was againſt that Opinion. <hi>If</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>the Apoſtle ſpake</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We were by nature the children of wrath as well</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 3. Pſalm 51. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>as others:</hi> And the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in Sin did my mother conceive me;</hi> that theſe places muſt be accounted hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, and not to have a proper ſenſe, is the ſpecial evaſion of Modern Wits, not comparable to Ancienter Judgments, more ſimply underſtanding them. I know a more colourable interpretation is made by others, who interpret <hi>Conceiving in ſin</hi> as relating to the Parents, and not to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But this is leſs probable than the ordinary and obvious ſenſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to <hi>David.</hi> For though it may be probable enough that Parents may offend in acts of Procreation, and ſo the child may be ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55232:179"/>
by them in ſin: yet <hi>David</hi> being at the ſpeaking of theſe words in deepeſt repentance for his own ſins, cannot be ſaid to leave off that ſubject, and to confeſs the ſins of others, and charge his parents with that which concerned him not. Again, when he ſays <hi>He was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> nothing could he ſay more intimately to ſignifie his proper ſtate, at the time of his firſt conception.</p>
                     <p>But the Scriptures do not only barely ſay, we are originally thus infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſinful, but, by the effects and certain other indications, declare the ſame. The firſt and chiefeſt of which may be Death, and puniſhments ſticking cloſe to infants at their birth, and even before they come into the world: Now the Law of God being unalterable, that puniſhment ſhould follow, and not go before ſin; it muſt be that ſomewhat of the nature of ſin muſt prepare the way for ſuch ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That all men come to years of diſcretion are effected with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſin, few of the oppoſers of Original ſin, deny; But according to Reaſon and Scripture both, the fountain being ſo infected and corrupted, whatever flows from it muſt, of neceſſity, partake of the ſame evil. <hi>For</hi>

Can a fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? either a vine, figs? ſo can no fountain yield both ſalt water and freſh.</hi> From whence it follows, by way of juſt Analogy, That the Fountain being corrupt, there muſt be derived to the Rivolets the like unſoundneſs.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, we ſee this by experience, that both bodily and mental infirmities and diſorders, are traduced from Father to Son in actual Evils: as the Gout, Stone, and Leproſie are tranſinitted to poſterity from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and Anger, and other paſſions in like manner. It may as well be ſaid That the Son hath the Gout, and halts by imitation, and not by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that ſuch other affections, which are common to Father and Son, ſo proceed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Argument which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> could never, by the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> be anſwered, taken from Baptiſm. For this they could not deny, but the Church univerſally practiſed Paeda-baptiſm (that is held an opinion manifeſted in practiſe that Children were capable of that Sacrament, and received the benefit of it, however ſome particular perſons deferred the ſame) and held it of uſe unto them, for the entring into the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore ſurely there muſt be ſome impediment, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment could be nothing but what hath the nature of ſin in it; therefore they bring ſin with them into the World. <hi>Pelagius</hi> had a good mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved) to have denyed the uſe of Baptiſm, but as bold as he and his great ſecond <hi>Julian</hi> of <hi>Capua</hi> was, the general Judgment of the Church declared in the practiſe of it, put a ſtop to his inclinations: but <hi>Socinus,</hi> bolder than any Heretick before him, ſticks at no ſuch thing, but flatly denyes the uſe of it to all but ſuch as are converted newly to the Chriſtian Faith, as in the times of the Apoſtles. This was freely and roundly invented and uttered; and which ſuffices alone to convince us of the former errour, denying Original Sin, which was alwayes held a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſe of Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Thus much may be obſerved by natural Reaſon to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Original Sin, which <hi>Seneca</hi> noted, but could give no reaſon of. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is of a good mind, before he is of a bad one: we are all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi> And in the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>No body is with difficulty reduced
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55232:180"/>
to Nature, but he that hath made a defection from it.</hi> Now, ſuppoſing that God made all things perfect, and inſtituted the nature of man more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to acts agreeable to that perfection, than to the contrary, whence can it come that contrariwiſe, Man naturally inclineth to that which is baſe, and unworthy, and is hardly taken off that corrupt way of acting contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reaſon and vertue, and reduced to a perfection becoming his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and End, but that the very principle of his nature is hurt, and the root corrupt? And becauſe nothing can be Author of its own Principles, by which it ſubſiſts, no man can be ſaid by his own act, to have corrupted them. Indeed we ſay, a Man is of corrupt Principles, when he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome evil habits diſpoſing to wickedneſs, but that is acceſſorie, and not innate to him.</p>
                     <p>And if it be farther urged, That no man can be guilty by anothers fault, nor corrupted by anothers principle; it is anſwered as before, ſo long as it is only that others, and not his own in ſome degree: For as <hi>Thomas</hi> hath diſtinguiſhed, <hi>There is a Principle of Nature, and a Principle of a Perſon: and a Sin of Nature, and a Sin of a Perſon. Adam</hi> had not only princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereby he himſelf ſubſiſted, but alſo was the principle of all his Succeſſours. So that Original ſin was as well the ſin of the one as the other. So that from the depraved will of <hi>Adam</hi> as the firſt principle of all, came the corruption of the Will of all: Whereupon ſpeaking ſtrictly (as we have ſaid) this Original ſin is not properly ſin in the Infant; but, a want of Original Juſtice ſeizing him, and expoſing him to deſtruction: as <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Catharinus</hi> alſo have taught: which two are the effects of the ſin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> upon himſelf and children: but the very formal Reaſon of ſin in his Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>For where, as ſome ſay, It is natural Concupiſcence moving to Evil: and others, That it is the abſence of Divine Juſtice and Grace, they differ rather in the niceties of ſpeech, than in the matter it ſelf. For to me it ſeems that the loſs of Divine Perfection and Grace, ſuperadded to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, whereby he was abundantly able to ſecure himſelf and glorifie God in that ſtate of happineſs, moſt neerly expreſſes the nature of it, as in the ſons of <hi>Adam.</hi> (For in <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf it was actual diſobedience) but Concupiſcence inordinate doth rather expreſs the conſequence of it: For upon that deſolation in the ſoul of Man, quickly aroſe a diſorder of the inferiour Affections, which by a general name is called <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> or <hi>Luſt</hi> by the Apoſtle, in his Seventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> it is called, becauſe, as out of the curſed ground ſprang up briers, thorns, weeds and thiſtles, where more uſeful fruit of the earth was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſo upon this curſe of mans ſoul, Evil motions aroſe to the hurrying him to Actual ſin, being themſelves really ſinful.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is obſervable, for the true reſolution of the Queſtion, That there is commonly an ambiguity in this tearm, <hi>Concupiſcence;</hi> it being ſometimes taken for the act, and exerciſe of that vitious principle in man fallen; and ſometimes for the <hi>Pravitie,</hi> and degenerate temper of the ſoul, making it prone to actual ſins. This latter is that which is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Original Sin;</hi> though more properly Original unholineſs, or want of that inſtituted Integrity, with which man was at firſt endowed: and in it three things are to be conſidered; Firſt, the privation of Supernatural Good. Secondly, Proneneſs to unnatural Evil, againſt God. Thirdly, Odiouſneſs and Culpableneſs before God, who muſt needs be offended at the ſight of ſo much deformity in his Creature, contrary to his firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55232:180"/>
of it and Intention; though this evil habitude ſhould never break out into actual Rebellion againſt him, by the exerciſe, or putting it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by actual Concupiſcence, againſt the Law of God: St. <hi>James</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 14.</note> to juſtifie this diſtinction, where he ſaith; <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſts, and enticed:</hi> This gives us the original Luſt or Concupiſcence, which inclines and moves to ſin, and to this is it to be imputed, that a man ſo eaſily is withdrawn from truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and noble acts becoming his high nature. He goeth on: <hi>Then when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin,</hi> &amp;c. that is, when the Radical Concupiſcence, or Concupiſcibleneſs in man becomes impregnated and matured by outward opportunities and occaſions of ſinning, it bringeth forth into outward act, ſin: and the event and conſequence of this ſin, is death. So that the innate Luſt lurking in the Soul, and not actuated by outward occaſions either inwardly to effect and deſire, or outwardly to act ſin, is not properly ſin, but metonymically only; either as it is the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, or the cauſe of our ſins, but it is properly odious to God, and expoſing us to his heavy wrath, ſo far at leaſt as is ſeen in the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that be atitude, to which man was at firſt deſigned. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agrees with the nature of that ſin: For as that which was in <hi>Adam</hi> was actual diſobedience, in his Poſterity is only want of that perfection which was due to their nature: So <hi>Adam</hi> not only incurred the loſs of that bliſs he was capable of, and in the ready way to enjoy, but likewiſe the puniſhment of Senſe, anſwerable to his Sin of Commiſſion: and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was made ſubject to the puniſhment and loſs of Gods favour, and that bliſs they were, in <hi>Adam,</hi> once ordained unto. But when their Sins become Actual, they are ſubject to puniſhment of <hi>Pain,</hi> and torment for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And by this, the way is well prepared to make anſwer to that common doubt concerning the effect of Baptiſm, and the ſtate of the Regenerate, in reference to Original ſin, and Concupiſcence; <hi>viz.</hi> whether Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence remaining after Baptiſm in the Regenerate be ſin or not.

                        <hi>tantum malum, and ſuch and-ſo great Evil</hi> [as that Original] <hi>only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in a man, would oblige us to death, and drag us to the laſt death, but that its chain was broken in baptiſm.</hi> All this we ſubſcribe to, and do profeſs that the hold Original ſin had over us, is looſed by Baptiſm. Yet we profeſs with <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo quoted, that when ever ſuch Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence comes into the Will, be it of Regenerate or Unregenerate, it puts on the nature of ſin. But we ſuppoſe the remains of that Original Evil to contain themſelves, where Baptiſm left them; and not to proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this God certainly hates, (I mean progreſs of Concupiſcence) and as it is well argued, God cannot hate any thing but ſin. But after Regeneration by Baptiſm, or reſtauration to the vertue and power of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the benefit thereof, by Repentance; the Sin in kind, as Luſt, Envie, Murder, Malice is odious unto God, but as it relates to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon once guilty of it, it is no longer odious unto God: why? becauſe it is covered, it is pardoned, it is not imputed, it is as if it had not been. For otherwiſe, it could not be ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion</hi>

                        <hi>of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſactified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of his Grace.</hi> Meaning, that upon their converſion unto Chriſt, their waſhing in Baptiſm, their having received the Holy Ghoſt, they were acquitted from their former ſins, and judged innocent and pure before him. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 26.</note> how Chriſt, as an High Prieſt, once in the end of the world hath appeared to put away ſin, by the Sacrifice of himſelf. And to what end ſhould any man multiply Texts to prove this, to them, who will affirm that all ſin is damnable, and grant that the Regenerate are not in a ſtate of Damnation? then ſurely they are not properly ſinners or guilty. I ſpeak of the ſtate of Remiſſion and Abſolution, and as ſuch, as all Infants baptiſed are: And the grown Chriſtian, becauſe he may, and is moſt prone to incur new ſins, after ſuch abſolution and purgation, is not therefore to be ſaid, not to have been truly abſolution and purgation, is not therefore to be ſaid, not to have been truly freed from the guilt of ſin paſſed before his baptiſm, and thorow repentance. For that this may happen, experience and the teſtimony of St <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>through the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and overcome; the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what do they but in effect come off from their opinion of ſinfulneſs in that Concupiſcibleneſs, rather than Concupiſcence in the Regenerate, who after all, plainly grant that there is no guilt remaining in it, of it ſelf, and thus anſwer the argument, which proveth that it is no ſuch ſin as they
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55232:181"/>
hold, becauſe, <hi>Original ſin is the death of the ſoul, and makes a man an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God: but Concupiſcence in the Regenerate doth not this;</hi> thus: <hi>Original ſin doth not cauſe ſpiritual death, but only as it is linked with guilt; but pardon being obtained in Baptiſm, the guilt is taken away, and makes not any man lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wrath, but as he is found in the old</hi> Adam: <hi>ſo ſoon as a man is of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Regenerate, he is found in the new</hi> Adam, <hi>i. e. in Chriſt.</hi> Now would it be known, how any thing of the true nature of ſin, may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from guilt: which is too hard for me to apprehend; they being ſo intimately coupled together, and convertible; that, as there cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any guilt without ſin, ſo neither any ſin without guilt. And if they ſay, the guilt is done away in Baptiſm or Repentance, I will ſay, the ſin is done away too, and maintain it. If they had diſtinguiſhed between the effects and fruits of Original ſin, and the ſin it ſelf, the matter had been much plainer and eaſier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by their manner of proceeding in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it ſhould ſeem they only drive at this. For I grant what they allow, that Baptiſm doth not free from all corruption of Original ſin, ſuch as are blindneſs of the Mind, and debility of the Will, to embrace good entirely, and infirmities of the body, which by a Metonymie are called ſin ſometimes: but the <hi>guilt,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily, or do nothing at all; but what <hi>Calvine</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and many dancing after their Pipe (to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the Sacraments and the Reformation) admit us into the outward communion of the Church, and ſignifie the pardon of our ſins from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without including Baptiſm or Repentance, which is made no more then a ſign too.

Which agrees with what we delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, that, though we may give, and lament for the miſery of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified nature in us, by our fall in <hi>Adam;</hi> yet we are not bound to pray for the remiſſion of it, after our regeneration. It may be inſerted into our confeſſion, as a part of our miſery, thereby to move God to a more full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the loſs ſuſtained, but not as to the obtaining of forgiveneſs of the guilt. It may ſerve for our humiliation and aſpiration to a fuller delivery from the infelicity we are under, by the remains of it, not from the guilt of it, which is the ſinfulneſs, wholly extinguiſhed by thoſe waters.</p>
                     <p>For as it is with a ſon to whom his father hath committed a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wealth, of money and rich cloathing than he could well expect, during his minority, which money and rayment he hath in riotous living &amp; wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company, loſt and imbezelled; though he returns ſo far into the favour of his father, as to have his offence pardoned, and is taken into his family, and hath the promiſe of being heir of his Eſtate, notwithſtanding his former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, yet hath not at preſent the like affluence and ornaments reſtored to him as he was once poſſeſſed of: So God dealeth ordinarily with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, made ſuch by Baptiſm, the crime is remitted to them, which they were guilty of, they are accepted into his favour, and become part of his holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the Church; they are aſſured of the future inheritance in Heaven. Yet doth not God thereby preſently reſtore all that in <hi>Adam</hi> was prodigally loſt by them, and mis-ſpent; but ordains that they ſhould, by their future good and dutiful behaviour, and his ordinary allowance of Grace given them, <hi>Occupie

until he comes,</hi> and by daily improvement in Grace, arrive at laſt, by little and little, to the perfect conſummation in Glory. After Baptiſm, therefore, there is that <hi>Lucrum ceſſans,</hi> as they call it, that want of benefit which was once enjoyed fully and freely, and continues of the nature of puniſhment, after pardon ſealed to us: But the <hi>Damnum emergens,</hi> or poſitive damage or evil doth ceaſe; God forbearing further to vindicate himſelf than what naturally ſprings from the foreſaid defects remaining in the Regenerate: and this too, not ſo much with an evil eye, as a good intention to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to reduce them nearer and nearer to him, by ſuch exerciſes. And hereby I ſuppoſe is competently anſwered alſo that Scholaſtical doubt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved chiefly in reference to Actual ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether God doth properly puniſh his children for thoſe ſins which he hath pardoned unto them before. The Scripture, which is not wont to ſpeak Logically, preciſely, or Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally but popularly &amp; familiarly, doth many times call that puniſhment from God (becauſe nothing can happen without his order and diſpenſation) which is rather to be imputed to the imperfect ſtate of Regeneration in this life, and the unreſtored integrity in man, than the unpardonedneſs of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. And again, it declareth ſo full ſatisfaction made by Chriſt for the ſins of the Penitent, and freeneſs of Gods Grace, that without calling in queſtion the juſtification of a ſinner, and the juſtice of God, no more can be exacted of the pardoned than what is paid. But, as is ſaid, a ſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to his father may be fully forgiven and aſſured of the inheritance expected, yet through want of that plenty denyed him, not good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may fall into many wants and troubles, which ſhould not have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, had he at firſt perſevered in his duty and felicity.</p>

                        <p> Of the Reſtitution of Man after ſin. The Means and Motives thereunto. In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Chriſts Mediation was neceſſary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of Man to God. <hi>Socinus</hi> his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſts Mediation refuted. That Chriſt truly and properly ſatisfied by his Death and Paſſion for us.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND thus have we paſſed one great Period of Gods Divine Providence, in relation to the fall of Man: For (as hath been ſaid) the Providence of God conſiſting of his <hi>Power, Juſtice, Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> is ſeen no leſs conſpicuouſly in the due diſpoſing of Evil to the general good of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as likewiſe to his Glory, than in diſpenſing of Good to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; though this latter affects us moſt. Now therefore we are to proceed to that Second moſt eminent Act of Gods more than Paternal Providence to Mankind, in his Reſtauration. And here we are to conſider, firſt the Motives inducing God to ſuch a benign acceptation of him to favour: Then the Means whereby this was accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>And the former we may ſoon diſpatch from what we before noted out of <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> that the firſt Original of Gods great deſign, and fountain of favour towards loſt Man, did, and muſt needs ſpring from his own good will and inclination to Mercie, immediately; without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whatever. For neither Mans miſery, nor any of thoſe many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Schoolmen, Fathers, or Poſtillers to render a reaſon why God ſhould be more inclined to favour Man than the lapſed Angels, can be of any tolerable account to incite or invite God to Mercy in this caſe; no, nor the conſideration of Chriſt: For Chriſt was not the firſt reaſon which prevailed with God to have mercie, but his own natural Grace (as I may ſo ſpeak) diſpoſed him firſt in general, to the end: And the end, Mans reſtitution, being thus propounded and determined by himſelf, Chriſt was in order of cauſes, elected as a Mediatour and Means deſigned to bring to paſs that end. And this the holy Scriptures affirm. St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon recorded in the <hi>Acts,</hi> thus ſpeaks of him: <hi>And he commanded us</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 10. 42, 43</note> 
                        <hi>to preach unto the People, and to teſtifie, that it is he which was ordained of God, to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhould receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt then is not the firſt Motive of Gods favourable Decree to Man; but Chriſt is the firſt Means whereby that Decree was executed and brought to effect. And this being granted and premiſed, the doubt concerning the abſolute or hypothetical neceſſity of Chriſts becoming incarnate, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55232:183"/>
Mans ſalvation; that is, more plainly, Whether ſo neceſſary it was that Chriſt ſhould appear a Mediatour between God and Man, as there were no poſſible ſalvation without it, or that only upon, or becauſe God had ſo decreed it, that none ſhould be ſaved but by Chriſt; may ſeem half ended. For it is out of queſtion, that as the caſe now ſtands (as they ſpeak, <hi>in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>ſenſu compoſito</hi>) God having determined that no other name under heaven be given whereby men muſt be ſaved, that there is no ſalvation in any other, but in Chriſt Jeſus. But ſecluding that Decree, it doth not appear why God out of the Abyſs of his Counſels, and Immenſneſs of his Wiſdome, and abſoluteneſs of his Free Grace, might not have compaſſed Mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſome other way. My Reaſon, beſides thoſe I find uſed by others, is that now intimated. If God could entertain ſuch favourable thoughts towards Man as to decree his Salvation without intuition of Chriſt: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he might have effected it without Chriſt. For 'tis neither juſt nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to imagine that God could decree any thing abſolutely, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bring it to paſs, for we cannot ſo judge of Gods Counſels, as we do of Mans; who alwayes determines with ſuppoſition of means, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to bring to paſs what he determined: but all cauſes out of himſelf, being, without exception, ſubject to his will, nay his will needing no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means to attain its purpoſe or reſolution, it is ſufficient argument that ſuch a thing may be, that God without conſideration of any means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees it, and at his liberty chooſes thoſe means he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>Neither upon this ſuppoſition is the advantage ſuch as the Socinian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick expects to his cauſe. It is one of his pernicious hereſies, That Chriſt ſatisfied not by his Paſſion, he expiated not the offenſe of Man thereby, but left him many a good leſſon to direct and inſtruct him in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſet him an excellent and fair example to follow: Makes now at laſt, being in heaven, (not before) interceſſion, and mediates for man: but his death was no ſatisfaction for the wrath of God conceived againſt the ſinner. And to make way to this opinion, he ſays, that God might without any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, have freely remitted mans offence: and therefore it was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and indiſpenſably requiſite, that Chriſt ſhould dye. If we ſhould yield all this which is here taken for granted, which yet if it be not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not ſo eaſie to be demonſtrated; there appears no great advantage to their cauſe. For if it be aſſured unto us out of holy Writ, that God hath determined that no ſalvation ſhould be attained, no recovery had without the mediation of Chriſt, and his ſatisfaction, what availeth it them that poſſibly it might have been otherwiſe? I confeſs the advantage to the other ſide would have been much greater, if it could be proved that Gods juſtice of abſolute neceſſity, muſt have been ſatisfied by fulfilling the penal part of the Law: but however, there remains evidence enough from the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will of God, which, according to Scriptures, admits of no other way now.

Surely therefore, a ſenſe there is wherein it is impoſſible God ſhould remit ſins without due puniſhment for the ſame inflicted; and the leaſt and loweſt is that which we call conditional, ſuppoſing that God hath ſo decreed that no ſin ſhould be expiated but that way. A way, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the excellent agreement it hath with the Juſtice of God, and Mercy alſo, is full of pregnant advices and inſtructions to the Offender, partly informing of the foul and mortal nature of ſin, which cannot otherwiſe be pardoned than by ſuch ſatisfaction of bloud: partly by humbling him, and moving him to cry God mercy bitterly and heartily; and laſtly, by poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind with a dread and terrour of the nature of ſin, ſo as to avoid the ſame for the time future.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of the Nature and Perſon of the Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man. <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> proved to be ſpoken of Christ: and that he had a Being before he was Incarnate. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of two Natures in Chriſt explained. Chriſt a Mediatour by his Perſon, and by his Office, and this by his Sacrificing himſelf. The Scriptures proving this.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THUS far of the neceſſity and uſe of Mediation between God and Man, for the reconciling them at this great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Now it remains to ſpeak more particularly of the Perſon or Mediatour himſelf, whom Chriſtian Faith acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> who, as the Scripture tells us, <hi>came unto the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and to ſave them by his Mediation:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> And that this is a faithful ſaying, that is, a truth to be embraced by true Faith, without which there is no Salvation.</p>
                     <p>But of the Condition of this Mediatour we find no ſmall differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch who are called Chriſtians. They are of three ſorts. Some profeſs him to be God, but deny him to be true and real Man: Others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be Man, but deny him to be God: But the Faith truly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſes both; <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was God and Man. We ſhall remit (for brevities ſake) the Reader to what hath been ſaid before, proving the myſtery of the Trinity out of the Scriptures, and that Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the Trinity is the Son of God by natural Generation, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to us. And to prove the ſecond out of the word, now there is ſcarce one ſuch Heretick who denyes it, may ſeem ſuperfluous. That which is to be demonſtrated, is, That there was time of union of that ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity with Man, and that this union was ſuch that it conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not two Perſons, but one; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly writeth to <hi>Timothy: There is one God and one Mediatour between God and man, the Man Chriſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And therefore, whatever doctrine ſo ſpeaks of this Myſtery, as to divide the Natures into two Perſons, as if there were two Mediatours, two Saviours, two Chriſts between God and Man, deſtroyeth the Faith of a Chriſtian, no leſs than that doth which denyes theſe two Natures to concur in one Perſon: the Eternal and Divine Nature and Perſon aſſuming, in the fulneſs of time, humane Nature inconfuſedly into the Divine.</p>
                     <p>To the proving this, we take that as a ſure ground and founadtion which St. <hi>John</hi> hath laid to build his Goſpel on: That there was an Eternal Divine Nature, <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the beginning, and that this Divine Nature was diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by three diſtinct Perſons: that one of theſe Perſons is called the Word:
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55232:184"/>
For he ſaith, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>God, and the Word was God.</hi> Ridiculous are the violences offered to theſe words by Hereticks, who firſt take here <hi>Beginning,</hi> not for that higheſt (and higher than the Creatures comprehenſion can mount to) of all dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which none is afore, and none come properly after, but for a tearm of time properly fixt; and for want of more remarkable, do pitch upon the firſt publication of the Goſpel as that beginning; anſwerable (forſooth) unto that ſpeech of <hi>Moſes, In the beginning God created the heaven and the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>earth:</hi> but the agreement is too little to make ſuch interpretation: becauſe it is plain that heaven and earth not only had a beginning, but gave begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to time it ſelf, meaſured and obſerved by them. And it is plain, that the Goſpel did not begin ſo ſoon by almoſt thirty years as Chriſt began, according to his humane nature. And if it be taken of the Perſon of Chriſt, What can be more abſurd than to ſay, <hi>In the beginning was the Word?</hi> that is, Chriſt began when he began. Therefore the word here, can neither be taken for the Goſpel, or Word preacht, but it muſt be meant of a word ſuperiour and anteriour to both: as doth yet more plainly appear from the phraſe uſed, <hi>The Word was with God, and the Word was God:</hi> For the heavens and earth which are ſaid in <hi>Geneſis</hi> to be made in the beginning, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid either to have been with God, or to have been God: nor can the humane nature of Chriſt, not extant till ſome thouſands of years after the firſt Creation be ſaid to have been in the beginning with God: and much leſs to have been God: And the like may be ſaid of the Word ſpoken by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: which the Scriptures do not reckon to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at Chriſts birth, nor many years after. For thus ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius, That Word ye know which was publiſhed throughout all</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 10. 37.</note> Judea, <hi>and began from</hi> Galilee, <hi>after the Baptiſm which</hi> John <hi>preached.</hi> The Word therefore, according to this account, was not at the beginning, but after <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm. But this is not all, this is nothing in compariſon of what is added, <hi>The Word was God:</hi> The humane nature of Chriſt preciſely taken was not God: therefore another <hi>Word</hi> muſt be allowed to be God: And that muſt be the Word Eternal and Perſonal. And if this be doubted of, I thus argue from the words following. In that ſenſe, that Chriſt is ſaid to be Light, is he ſaid to be the Word, but Chriſt is ſaid to be Light, and the Light is ſaid to be Chriſt, and St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt diſavows that Light,<note place="margin">John 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and aſcribes it to Chriſt. And therefore, as the Perſon of Chriſt is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the Light, ſo is it by Word.</p>
                     <p>And how can we poſſibly make ſenſe of Chriſts words in St. <hi>John,</hi> if Chriſt prae-exiſted not, before he came into the World, in the fleſh? <hi>And now glorifie thou me, O Father, with that glory which I had with thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 18. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the foundation of the World.</hi> It may be ſaid, that before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, ſuch decree of glory might be given to one future; but thus it cannot be ſaid of him who is deſcribed to be actually poſſeſſed of it, before the foundation of the World: and that a man is ſaid to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, which he is ſaid to have had, as here. And how could Chriſt ſay truly, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am?</hi> when he was not Fifty years old, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">John 8. 57, 58.</note> to the Jews account? And that he puts a diſtinction between his comming from the Father, and his ſeeing the Father otherwiſe than any before him, or of his time, proves a prae-exiſtence and preſence ſingular with God. <hi>Not any man hath ſeen the Father, ſave he which is of God, he hath ſeen the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 6. 46, 62.</note> 
                        <hi>Father.</hi> And to this, adde what follows: <hi>What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> Doth not this plainly imply, that as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55232:185"/>
Chriſt did really aſcend after his Reſurrection, and ſate at the right hand of God in his humane nature; ſo he was there before, ſome way or other; and no way can be thought of but his Divine nature: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimated to the Epheſians, <hi>He that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>all heavens</hi>—. Now if any will be ſo captious as to except againſt this, becauſe the Divine Nature cannot properly be ſaid to deſcend, becauſe it filleth all things; it is true in rigour of ſpeech, what they ſay, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of ſpeech frequent in Scripture: which then affirmeth God to deſcend, when, as in the caſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 21.</note> and revealeth himſelf more ſenſibly, as Chriſt did, taking humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on him.</p>
                     <p>And this prae-exiſtent Nature of Chriſt to his humane being proved, that theſe were ſo united together, muſt be alſo ſhown. And to this, the ſingle expreſs teſtimony of St. <hi>John</hi> may ſuffice an equal mind. <hi>The Word</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>was made Fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us: And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God ſent</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the Fleſh:</hi> he implyeth that there were two tearms conſidered in Chriſt, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ſent. Firſt, there is the Perſon by whom, or from whom the Party is ſent; and that here was God: Secondly, there was the Party, or tearm to whom, and that was either to the World in general, or to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſubſtance of Fleſh ſo aſſumed by him, and which is here intended. Now it cannot be that the Act of ſending ſhould be the ſame with making: but firſt a Thing is, before it is ſent, and the rearm <hi>to which,</hi> muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that <hi>which is</hi> ſent. Therefore Chriſt, according to the Phraſe of holy Scriptures, being ſent to take Fleſh, muſt have, of neceſſity, a ſubſiſtence before; which ſubſiſtence muſt be of a Divine Nature: as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo witneſſed in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews. For as much then as children</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 2. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame.</hi> That is, the perſon of Chriſt took part of the maſs of humane Fleſh and Nature, when he was formed of the ſubſtance of his Mother in her womb. And in that it follows, <hi>Verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 16.</note> What can be more neceſſarily implyed than a Perſon prae-exiſting, to whom (according to the nature of the thing) it was indifferent to have taken the nature of Angels, or the Fleſh of man: and that it pleaſed God to ſend his Son to man; and it alſo pleaſed his Son to elect humane nature to dwell in: ſo that the <hi>manner</hi> of Chriſt thus conſiſting of two Natures, is matter of difficulty, rather than the thing it ſelf; <hi>i. e.</hi> how two Natures can be, and how they were, and are actually united in Chriſt.</p>

                           </gap> 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. 1.</note> we cannot ſtay here to ſpeak. <hi>Thomas</hi> reduces all unto three. One union is of things that are abſolute and perfect in themſelves, as many ſtones make one heap. Another is, when things in nature perfect, are ſo united that they ceaſe thereby to be perfect of themſelves; as when the Elements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr to make one perfect mixt body. Thirdly, when diverſe things being in nature imperfect not abſolutely, but in that they are naturally capable of greater perfection, and tend thereunto: as the ſoul and body, and the ſeveral members of the body conſtitute one man. But after none of theſe, exactly, can Chriſt be ſaid to conſiſt of two natures united. Not the firſt way, becauſe ſuch things are rather relatively and denominatively one, than really. Not the ſecond; becauſe it were to ſuppoſe that the Divine Nature could be alterable and mutable: and becauſe, if ſuch a compoſition
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55232:185"/>
were made, both the Divine and Humane nature muſt looſe their natural being and kind, and ſo neither of both remain, but a third thing. Not the laſt, becauſe both Divine and humane nature are perfect of themſelves in their kind. So that in truth, ſpeaking ſtrictly, no precedent in Nature can be found anſwering this Union, called Hypoſtatical, or Perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nal: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the union of two intire Natures into one Perſon; and that, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon of the Trinity, God bleſſed for evermore. But of the former, the laſt repreſenteth this Myſtery moſt clearly, and is often uſed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers to expreſs the ſame; and eſpecially by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Creed, who thus declareth this miſtery ſufficiently to the ſober and modeſt, and not curious mind. [<hi>Chriſt is] God of the ſubſtance of the Father, begotten before the worlds, and man of the ſubſtance of his mother born in the world. Perfect God, and perfect man; of a reaſonable ſoul, and humane fleſh ſubſiſting. Equal to God, as touching his God-head; and inferior to his Father as touching his Manhood: Who although he be God and man, yet he is not two, but one Chriſt. One, not by converſion of the Godhead into Fleſh, but by taking of the manhood into God: One altogether, not by confuſion of ſubſtance, but by unity of perſon. For as the reaſonable ſoul and fleſh is one man; ſo God and Man is one</hi> Chriſt. Now the ground of this great miſtery, is taken partly from the teſtimonies and deſcriptions of Chriſt the Mediator made in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: where, beſides thoſe already given, diverſe proper to God are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him; and many which are proper to humane nature are attributed to him: and becauſe there can be nothing more abſurd in nature or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, than to imagine that Chriſt is more than one Perſon, one Son, one Mediator; therefore it follows neceſſarily that this one Perſon muſt conſiſt of more than one nature: and partly becauſe the end of Chriſt being Incarnate, ſeemed to require this moſt neceſſarily. As Firſt, there was all reaſon that the nature which ſinned and offended ſhould ſuffer, and ſatisfie; but none but humane nature had ſo ſinned. Secondly, that he ſhould be a Prophet to inſtruct and teach his Church. Thirdly, that he ſhould be a King to rule and direct his Church, according to the Propheſies of old concerning him. For <hi>Moſes</hi> truly ſaid unto the Fathers, <hi>a Prophet ſhall</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 3. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me;</hi> which muſt be of humane condition.</p>
                     <p>Now according to this union of the Divine and Humane nature in one Perſon, may Chriſt in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be a Mediator <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> being a Mean Perſon, not ſimply God, nor ſimply Man: but this is not the proper Mediation of Chriſt between God and Man; but this rather conſiſteth in Acts performed, and Offices of Chriſt. And theſe acts of Chriſt may be diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, Preparatory and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory. The former I call preparatory, becauſe they were ordained as uſeful expediencies, not as eſſential to Reconciliation between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at diſtance. And the firſt act of this nature was after the manner of Civil Arbitrements, to take the Caſe into ſerious conſideration, and to deliberate with himſelf about the moſt proper means of attaining an amicable compoſure of differences on foot. <hi>And</hi> (as the Scripture<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> ſaith) <hi>foraſmuch then as the children</hi> (of God to be redeemed) <hi>are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil.</hi> It appearing unto him that there was no ſuch proper or convenient means to Arbitrate between God and Man, as the taking upon him humane nature. For by this means, as <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to be
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55232:186"/>
the Interceſſour (<hi>medius et ſequeſter</hi>) between God and the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (and therefore the Law is ſaid to have been given in the hand of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 5. Gal. 3. Hebr. 9. 15. 12. 24</note> who was <hi>Moſes</hi>) in like manner, Chriſt is called the Mediatour of a New Covenant, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> becauſe the tearms of that Covenant were obtained of God by Chriſt; and that Covenant was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him to manage and tranſact. Another Act of Chriſts mediation was by Prayers and Supplications, as it is in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews: <hi>Who in the dayes of his Fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications, with</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 5. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, was heard in that he feared.</hi> And in this reſpect he is called our Advocate by St. <hi>John,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 2. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> A third Act of Chriſt in his mediation related to Man, by offering to him the tearms and means of Reconciliation in knowledge and ſanctification, and moving him to accept of ſo favourable, free, and gracious tearms of Reconciliation, as the doctrine of the Goſpel preſented to him; thus fully expreſſed by St. <hi>Paul. All things are of God, who hath</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>reconciled us unto himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given unto us the miniſtry of reconciliation: To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us: we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the ſecond way of Mediation and Reconciliation is that which is moſt proper to Chriſt, the former being communicable to man in ſome ſenſe; namely, as the received power and authority from Chriſt, as is even now ſhewed, to miniſter in Chriſts ſtead, as inferiour Inſtruments under him: And this is by making himſelf a Sacrifice and Satisfaction for ſin: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, There is one God, and one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.</note>

                        <hi>in love as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and given himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> And when he ſaith, <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin:</hi> it is manifeſt that ſin, in the<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> firſt place, is uſed according to the Hebrew word, for <hi>a Sacrifice</hi> for ſin. Now nothing can be more frivolous in the ears of rational men, or more ſacrilegious in Gods ears, than to draw this to ſuch a kind of figurative ſpeech as <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Fellows do, as ſhould imply an occaſionalneſs and exemplarineſs only in Chriſts death to take away ſin, and not to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods Juſtice for them: And ſo to ſatisfie, as a Doctour ſhowing us the way, and as a Preſident leading us the way towards peace with God. This, I ſay can, in no propriety of ſpeech, be the meaning of holy Writ, aſſuring us firſt, That Chriſt was a Propitiation for us, as <hi>Romans</hi> 3. Whom God hath<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25. 1 John 2. 2. Epheſ. 2. 16.</note> ſet forth as a Propitiation, through Faith in his bloud. And St. <hi>John, He is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> tells us, how he became ſuch a propitiation for us. <hi>That he might reconcile both unto God, in one Body, by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby:</hi> Is Reconciliation of God and Man, and that by delivering up his body to death upon the Croſs, no more than to give us good inſtructions how to ſerve God, ſo as to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our ſelves to him? Is ſlaying the enmity, or extinguiſhing the enemy to us, the Devil; or the Enmity which was between God and us, no more than by good example to direct us how ſo to do? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe to the <hi>Romans</hi> plainly affirmeth that he reconciled us to God<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> by his death. Secondly, Who by purging us, or any man elſe, could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55232:186"/>
before theſe dayes, no more than good words and counſels? But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes he <hi>By himſelf purged our ſins.</hi> And that we may ſee that St.<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> was far from any ſuch intention and forced ſenſe as is modernly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on him, he writes thus alſo, <hi>It was therefore neceſſary that the paterns of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22, 23.</note> 
                        <hi>things in the heavens ſhould be purified with theſe, but the heavenly things themſelves with better Sacrifices than theſe. For Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning of which words muſt neceſſarily be this, that, whereas the errors and ſins under the Law which were paterns or types of the Goſpel were expiated by bloud and ſacrifices: But the heavenly things were purged by better things, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Sacrifice of Chriſt. Therefore if it cannot be ſaid that ſuch things were purified only by good precepts and documents given, but real bloud was ſhed for that purpoſe: Real, though much better and more precious bloud was ſhed for the expiation and purification the ſins of the Goſpel: which bloud was Chriſts. And thirdly, how moſt abuſively muſt the tearms <hi>Redeeming</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> be uſed by the Scripture, beyond all other writings or ſpeeches, if it ſignifies not a real recovery or purchaſe of ſomewhat loſt, or neceſſary to one? Now ſuch expreſſions applyed to Chriſts mediation, are ſo plain and frequent, that it may ſeem ſuperfluous to recite them. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Son of Man came to give his life a</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 20. 28. Titus 2. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>ranſome for many.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> by his compariſon uſed, ſheweth what manner of purchaſe it was, ſaying; <hi>Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation received by tradition from your Fathers: but with the precious bloud of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, without ſpot.</hi> But redemption with ſilver and gold is proper, and expiation by the bloud of Lambs was proper and real: therefore alſo muſt the redemption by the bloud of Chriſt be ſo too. And in the Epiſtle<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12. 13, 14</note> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is the like compariſon uſed moſt aptly, and at large. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the tearms <hi>Offering</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſo often aſcribe unto Chriſt, muſt needs import more then verbal, or exemplary mediation: divers of which places we have noted before: to which we may adde what in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly<note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 27.</note> ſpoken of Chriſt. <hi>Who needed not daily, as their High Prieſts, to offer up Sacrifice, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the peoples: for this he did once when he offered up himſelf.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Chriſt our Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>

                        <hi>is offered for us.</hi> And St. <hi>John? The Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the World.</hi> And elſewhere to this effect.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> How Chriſt was Mediatour according to both Natures: <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion and others ſtated. Of the effect of Chriſts Mediation, and the extent thereof. Of the Deſignation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſts death. Of the Sufficiencie and Efficacie of Chriſts death. How Chriſts death becomes effectual to all: The Neceſſity of Gods Grace to incline the will of man to embrace Chriſt: Of the Efficacie as well as Sufficiencie of Gods Grace on the Will of Man. Several Gradations obſerved in the Grace of God.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT from the Evidence of the evidence of the Fact, that ſo it was, that Chriſt ſuffered to ſatisfie for our ſins, let us paſs to the Manner, how it was; and the Effects and Extent for whom he ſo ſuffered and ſatisfied; becauſe no ſmall ſtir and contention hath been touching both; but briefly. For there ſeems not to me to be ſuch great cauſe, as is apprehended for ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, ſurely Chriſts mediation was an Act of his Perſon, and not of his Natures, either of them ſeparately conſidered: So that there ſeems the ſame reaſon for this, as for all other Acts and Attributes given to him: ſome whereof are naturally proper to the Divine Nature, and ſome to the Humane: and yet both theſe, predicable of Chriſt perſonally conſidered, by that received rule amongſt Divines, which maintaineth a communication of Idioms; or the aſcribing the property of one nature to the entire Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo denominatively to the other. In which ſenſe Chriſt is ſaid to dye, to ſuffer, to hunger, to thirſt, to be weary: and Chriſt is ſaid to be Omniſcient, Omnipotent, Omnipreſent: yet not according to both Natures, but as they are united into one Perſon. So that all Acts and Offices of Chriſt as Mediatour, have a twofold conſideration, Formal and Real, or <hi>Vertual</hi> and <hi>Interpretative,</hi> as they ſpeak. Some Acts are ſo <hi>formally Divine</hi> in him, that they pertain to the Humane Nature only <hi>Vertually;</hi> and ſome Acts are ſo <hi>formally</hi> and properly Humane that they pertain to the Divine Nature, only by way of <hi>imputation</hi> or <hi>interpretation;</hi> and not immediately or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. So that the Word Incarnate, Chriſt, is the immediate cauſe of his Mediation, and our Reconciliation, but all the Acts in particular tending tending to Chriſts mediation, as his preaching, and travelling, and Paſſion,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55232:187"/>
did not proceed equally, or alike from both Natures. For two things are to be diſtinguiſhed in the Actions or Paſſion of Chriſt mediating for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>value</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of that Action, in order to the reconciling of man to God. That the Acts conducing hereunto are only proper to the Humane Nature, is true according to <hi>Stancarus</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon. Epiſt. ad Matheſium.</note> though called Heretick, for the ſame; and oppoſed by <hi>Calvine</hi> and many of his Equals, who held that Chriſt was Mediatour according to his Divine and Humane Nature: And that <hi>Calvine</hi> and his Company muſt needs erre, is proved becauſe they reject <hi>Lombard</hi> and thoſe that follow him, who are the Romaniſts. <hi>Lombards</hi> Opinion was, That Chriſt was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour as the Word Incarnate, but not according to both Natures. For they diſtinguiſh <hi>Principium Quod,</hi> and <hi>Principium Quo,</hi> That <hi>Principle or Cauſe</hi> of mediation from that <hi>Whereby</hi> he mediated. The firſt they confeſs to be the Perſon of Chriſt, conſiſting of Divine and Humane Nature. The ſecond they make the Humane Nature alone. And that <hi>Calvine</hi> and the reſt meant any more, it is paſt the power of their Adverſaries to make good; however, according to their wont, they ſtrain all they can, and more than honeſtly they can, to make their Opinions foul and odious: For in ſubſtance, they ſpeak the ſame thing with <hi>Lombard,</hi> though not altogether after the ſame manner: but the Deformer ſuſpected him as juſtly for reſtraining Chriſts mediation and the value thereof to his Humanity, as the Romaniſts do them, for comprehending the Divinity in it. And rightly do they diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Thing,</hi> and the <hi>Efficacie</hi> of the thing: and that according to <hi>Lombard</hi> himſelf, whom they diſlike, becauſe he reſtrained (to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) the whole buſineſs of mediation to the Humane Nature: whereas though the Divine Nature did not formally act, or ſuffer to that end, yet it was by vertue of the Hypoſtatical Union with the Divine Nature, that the Humane Nature was in a capacity to mediate and merit for man: as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> hath taught us in theſe words. <hi>It was requiſite that the Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi>

                        <hi>God and Man ſhould have ſomewhat like unto God, and ſomewhat like unto Men: leſt being like God in all things, he ſhould be too far from men; or being like unto Man in all things, he ſhould be too far from God.</hi> And yet indeed in another place he doth determine the mediation more properly to the Humanity of Chriſt, than to the Word, thus ſpeaking: <hi>Yet he is not for this a Mediatour, becauſe he is the Word, and that eſpecially, becauſe he is immortal: and the moſt bleſſed Word is far from miſerable Mortals: But he is Mediatour, in that he is Man; ſhowing thereby, that we ought not to ſeek a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Mediatours to that, not only bleſſed, but beatifical Good, by whom we ſhould have acceſs,</hi> &amp;c. And to this agrees that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, There is one God and one Mediatour between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And this is the chiefeſt place founding this Opinion, yet not ſimply, ſeeing it is an eaſie matter by a diſtinction to avoid the ſame, if one would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious: but if Charity, nay if Juſtice were done to each ſide, the ground of contention might fairly be removed, in this.</p>
                     <p>But with much more difficulty do we meet in the effect and extent of the mediation of Chriſt by his Death and Paſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it concerns all Mankind in general, or Whether all thoſe who are called to the knowledge, faith, and profeſſion of Chriſt and Chriſtian Religion: or laſtly, Whether it was properly and ſpecially ſo deſigned and intended for ſuch as were to be infallibly ſaved, that others were capable of no benefit of the ſame; but rather were determined to hardneſs and impenitencie, and perſiſtance in unbelief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="334" facs="tcp:55232:188"/>Concerning the laſt and harſheſt part of this doubt, we have heretofore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that though the Holy Scriptures (which cannot be denyed) do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe<note place="margin">Exod. 4 21. &amp; 14. 17. Rom. 9. 18. Iſa. 6. 10. Deut. 2. 30. Iſa. 63. 17.</note> unto God in poſitive tearms, hardening of ſome, yet the meaning can be no more than that from certain perſons, he ſo withdraws his mollifying and maturing Grace to Repentance and Faith, that an effect of Obduration doth thereupon, in ſuch manner follow, as if God himſelf were the proper and direct Author of it. For all egregious things are, according to the phraſe of Scripture, often aſcribed unto God. As where we read a <hi>Sleep from the Lord was fallen upon the ſervants of</hi> Saul: that is, a proſound, or as it<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 12.</note> is there ſaid, <hi>a deep ſleep:</hi> though I deny not, but this might be literally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. And we read according to the original, of Oaks of God, and Hills of God, which import no more than exceeding high and ſtately ones. And I make no doubt but when it is ſaid, <hi>The ſons of God ſaw the daughters of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Geneſ. 6. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>men, that they were fair,</hi> &amp;c. Angels are not thereby intended; and doubt, whether, as is commonly conjectur'd, The children of God, or holy Seed, be there aimed at. For no reaſon can be given why Gyants ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther born of them than wicked men; but rather that they were a race of Men of extraordinary ſtature, called therefore the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> becauſe of their exceſſive greatneſs, as all other mighty things are ſaid to be of God: in which ſenſe egregious hardneſs is imputed unto God.</p>
                     <p>But to the main difficulty we muſt anſwer from the various manifeſtations of Gods love to Mankind. And where can we better begin to judge hereof, than from the firſt and ſecond ſtate of Man, his Inſtitution and Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is here taken for granted, That whole Mankind fell at once in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> from its priſtine perfection. And it is no leſs apparent, that God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to reſtore Man again, and recover him, treated as it were, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the ſame perſon <hi>Adam,</hi> and in the ſame capacity that he fell in. He fell, as is ſaid, equally to all men future, without any diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worſe, or better: higher or lower: and God treated and covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, without any clauſe of diſtinction, or exception of any one ſingle perſon: For in truth, though all actions relate immediately to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet the ſubſtance of the Treaty concerned principally the nature in general of Man; the promiſes of God being made with the Seed of the Woman, and Man, without any reſtriction or limitation: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, thus ſaying; <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf:</hi> by which<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> is ſignified a general and indiſtinct gift of God towards the lapſed maſs of Mankind: which gift likewiſe is expreſſed in the ſame latitude by St. <hi>John. For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son: that whoſoever</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>believes in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> But if there were in the firſt intention of God, any diſparity in exhibiting his ſon to the world, of that nature, that thereby certain perſons ſhould be excluded remedileſly from the number, for whom Chriſt dyed, then could it no more be ſaid that Chriſt became incarnate for them, then for the Devils, whoſe nature Chriſt took not. But ſurely there was a diſtinction made between repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Men, and reprobate Spirits. But this is not anſwered by the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in general, of <hi>Sufficiencie</hi> and <hi>Efficiencie,</hi> or efficacie of Chriſts death, uſed by <hi>Perkins,</hi> ſaying; <hi>That Chriſts death was ſufficient for all, but became not effectual to all.</hi> This is notoriouſly true, and undenyable; and that, as he ſayes, it was ſufficient for the redemption of many worlds if caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. For ſo it might be ſaid, It was ſufficient for the redemption of Devils too, for ought we know. And what of this? But <hi>Perkins</hi> ſeems to make a little bolder and farther ſtep, where he grants a kind of efficacie
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55232:188"/>
too: but ſomewhat of the harſheſt ſenſe: For diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> Efficacie, he addeth, <hi>Chriſt dyed potentially effectually for all men, but not actually effectually.</hi> But this potential efficacie rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, amounts to no more than a ſimple Sufficiencie; in regard that this Vertue, according to him, was never intended by God to be actuated in the behalf of the unpredeſtinated to life and glory.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond prejudice againſt that interpretation is, That the Scripture ſpeaking of the death of Chriſt and his Paſſion, doth not ſpeak of it as of a ſufficient rate and price in general, but a payment alſo actually made for all: for ſuch is the importance of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: Which ſignifie an actual payment, in relation to an obligation of Debt or Bondage; which places of Scripture we have before given. Thirdly, the Decree of exhibiting Chriſt actually and effectually in ſpecial manner to ſome elect perſons, who receive him by Faith, being thereunto moved and enabled by Gods inſpirations, is altogether poſteriour to the exhibition of Chriſt to Mankind in general; and therefore can be no real cauſe of Gods diſtinct intention then: or that God ſhould at his firſt propounding, put a difference in the manner of exhibiting Chriſts Perſons. For all this while we muſt allow two diſtinct Periods of Gods favourable Providence toward Man, in reſtoring him: the one, in his general Ordination of his Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him: the other, in the ſpecial collation and application of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to man. God gave his Son; and in him, his Obedience both in life and death to All men: But the effect and benefit of theſe redounded actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only to ſome ſelect perſons: This latter is undenyable by all ſides. For who did ever ſay that all men were actually ſaved by Chriſt? I know the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Chriſt was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a Payment made for all, is rejected by <hi>Perkins</hi> and his Aſſertour and Apologiſt <hi>Twiſſe.</hi> And true it is, that in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tearms above-mentioned, it is ſcarce to be found that Chriſt gave himſelf without a note of Reſtitution and Limitation, ſuch as <hi>Many,</hi> or <hi>To them that receive him, and believe in him.</hi> But then as the Scripture ſaith not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs tearms, that Chriſt was a Ranſom or Payment made for all; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it ſay, <hi>Only</hi> for the Elect, excluſively. And when it ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> And that <hi>God</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1. 29. John 3. 16. 1 John 4. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>That the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the World.</hi> We ſhall not need to ſhew how the Scripture doth frequently uſe the word <hi>World</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>true Believers:</hi> as where St. <hi>John</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>The World knew him</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1. John 17. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>not.</hi> And again, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the World,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo in other places; which do imply a Right the very Wicked and Reprobates have in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And whereas a principal argument is drawn from the words in St. <hi>John,</hi> laſt cited, to prove an inequality of intereſt in Chriſts death and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus: <hi>Chriſt only dyed for them he prayed for, but Chriſt prayed not for the World, i. e.</hi> the Wicked; <hi>Therefore he dyed not for them.</hi> If this were true, that Chriſt never prayed for the wicked; or for thoſe that were not then given actually to him, as were his Diſciples, for whom he there parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly prays, the argument would be of the greater force; but it is not ſo, any more then it is true in all reſpects, what Chriſt ſaith of himſelf in St. <hi>Matthew, I am not ſent but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> So<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 24.</note> that as Chriſt before his reſurrection ſhewed himſelf very nice, how he dealt the Word of Life to the Gentiles, ſo might he, at the ſame time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a more ſpecial deſire of the ſalvation of his elected Servants, than of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55232:189"/>
others. For we know (which is another anſwer) how the Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by a note of Denyal, doth not intend an <hi>abſolute</hi> excluſion of a thing, but <hi>comparative</hi> only: as where God ſays, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi> Chriſt prayed not for the world, ſo intenſly and particularly, or at that time: Therefore he prayed not at all, is no good conſequence. And no more is that which is made from an adequateneſs of the Death of Chriſt to the actual application of the merits of the ſame death, by ſuch interceſſion as Prayer. So that though Chriſt did not actually pray for all, yet he might dye for all: according to the diſtinction of a twofold<note place="margin">Quantum in Medico eſt, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If in anſwer to this doubt we ſhall ſay, That by Faith and Repentance we are made partakers of Chriſt, we ſhall anſwer moſt truly, but not ſufficiently; becauſe the ſame difficulty returns upon us, How ſome believe, and embrace Chriſt, and are made partakers of his benefits, and not others; ſeeing ſo great ſalvation is tendered to all?</p>
                     <p>Here it is abſolutely neceſſary to take in the Grace of God, and his free love towards Mankind, in ſome ſenſe at leaſt, by all that will be accounted Chriſtians; and not by wiſdome make void the Croſs of Chriſt. For ſuppoſing that God hath made a free and general Covenant with Mankind, which Covenant neither is, nor can (as it is a Covenant) be ſimple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionate, ſo far, as nothing ſhould be required thereby of Man, to the being capable of the benefit of it; it will of neceſſity follow, that the knowledge of this Covenant of Grace, muſt be had by ſuch as receive any benefit thereby: For elſe, how is it poſſible that they ſhould fulfill, in any manner, the Condition required; were it no more than ſome will make it, to receive it by Faith, without any more ado, then to believe themſelves into Gods Grace and Favour by a tacite internal act.</p>
                     <p>And this, and no more being ſuppoſed, that ſuch love and gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (for which no natural Cauſe can be found out to certifie or ſatisfie any man in the truth thereof) were ordained for any ſpecially, it muſt be known by Revelation and not Ratiocination: And all extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, beſides and above what Nature can diſcover, are purely Acts of Grace, and not of Work, And therefore, why God doth reveal his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to one people or perſon, and not to another, can have no other origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe then the [<hi>Beneplacitum</hi>] Good pleaſure of God; as is plainly<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 27.</note> affirmed by Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him:</hi> And before; <hi>I thank</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid thoſe things
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55232:189"/>
from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them unto babes.</hi> And in St. <hi>Peters</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Cor. 2 14.</note> caſe; <hi>Fleſh and bloud hath not revealed this unto thee.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Natural man cannot know the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> From whence it is manifeſt that though God hath decreed the Salvation of a man by Chriſt, yet this general intention cannot poſſibly take effect without a ſuper-added Act of Free Grace, whereby this Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made known. Again, it follows, That there is no obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God antecedent to his own will and inclination, moving him to reveal the ſame; and that only, out of Congruity, not of Juſtice or Neceſſity; as ſuppoſing a decree given to Man, which would be wholly unprofitable and vain, without ſuch revelation. But why one Man or Nation ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this gift rather than another, there is not ſo much as congruity to be fairly alledged, or reaſonably offered.</p>
                     <p>And as this is the firſt act of God on the underſtanding of Man, towards his reſtitution; ſo is the ſecond act of Man flowing mixtly from his Will and Underſtanding both, altogether owing to Gods Grace; and that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what before he knew. For that this is neceſſary, no doubt can be made, or that this is the true cauſe of being profited, or not, by Chriſt; St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus writing: <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> This diverſity is very great, but what is the cauſe of it, is not agreed upon. For if any ſhall ſay, It comes from the difference found in Chriſt as Mediatour, he is known to be miſtaken by what is ſaid. If any one ſhall ſay, It proceeds from the will and free Election of Man, he falls into a worſe abſurdity, for the will of man, as free, acts or works nothing at all, but as determined either by its ſelf, or by ſome other: And if by it ſelf, either ſimply and abſolutely, or joyntly with another cauſe. And this cauſe muſt be either taken from ſomewhat outward, as the object duly propounded, or inward, by way of efficiencie. But it cannot be any outward object preſenting it ſelf, only as a final cauſe, which hath only a moral and not natural influence: For if it be demanded to what end ſuch an inward act of the will is exerciſed, it may very properly and truly be ſaid, becauſe of the good diſcerned, and affected in the object: But if it ſhould be asked, How the Will is moved, and by vertue of what ability it ſo moves to that object? there could be no greater incongruity than to affirm, That the object was the cauſe of it: For here the efficient cauſe is ſought after. As when a man goes to Church, if doubt ſhould be made why he goes to Church, it were eaſily anſwered, becauſe he apprehends a ſpiritual good in that act; this is the final cauſe: but doth this give his leggs ſtrength, and his nerves and ſinews power to walk? Sure no man will ſay ſo. This then is that we enquire concerning the wills inclination to and election of ſpiritual things, not why? or to what end (for the end is the ſame to all mens wills) but, by what means it is fitted and enabled to move thitherward, rather than the contrary ways. The anſwer to this muſt (if a man will ſpeak appoſitely) be taken from the efficient cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Now this ſufficiencie or efficacie in the will, is either natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, which all modeſt Divines explode, or adventitious, and of free, undeſerved, and undeſired Grace and Gift of God. Hence another aſcent is made towards the Queſtion, of the manner of acceptation of grace and mercy, <hi>objectively</hi> taken. For as it is plain, that God putteth a difference, and not Man, between the underſtanding of one man and another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing that to one, which he doth not to another: And of thoſe that know the truth, putting a difference between the wills of men, in that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55232:190"/>
ſome, that have known the ſaving truth, have rejected it; and others em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it: as is yet farther manifeſt from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans. What</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for: but the Election hath obtained.</hi> To ſome then, who know the truth, God gives Grace, to ſome he doth not, or ſcarce diſcernable.</p>
                     <p>A third ſtep to this then, muſt be about the degree and eſſicacie of this <hi>firſt Grace</hi> of God preventing and preparing the will to ſuch noble ends; which it could never of it ſelf affect or deſire: And whether God doth give the like Grace, at leaſt in proportion, to all he hath ſo far called, illuminated and affected as to have ſpiritual principles of Life and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or not? It were too curious to enquire here about the Arithmetical proportion or quantity; becauſe that all mens conſtitutions and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not alike: and therefore, like more even timber or plyant clay, may be wrought into due form by leſs forcible means: but Whether, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all diſparities and diſproportion in the matter, the influence faſhioning the ſame, be of it ſelf ſufficient to any one called and outwardly elected to the truth: Or whether there be any ſufficient Grace which is not effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and conſummative of the end? which is the thing denyed by <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> againſt a ſtream of Adverſaries. But <hi>Thomas,</hi> who next to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ruled theſe Diſputes moſt of all, and that upon <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s doctrine and grounds, ſayes no leſs; and ſo do ſuch as ſtick cloſe to him; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſtrong oppoſition made by a Modern Order, who think to change the world, and make it take all doctrines from them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Predeceſſors, and the recalling the exil'd Tenets of Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſuch as ſerve, though at a diſtance, under him. They profeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and hold for him: They deny his Concluſions, but approve and juſtifie his Principles and Premiſſes, from which they certainly follow. Neither can they give St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a good word, whom none openly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ever preſumed to confront in that manner. Or, if they do ſpeak kindly of him, yet they take their own courſe, and ſpeak their own up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart ſenſe. For do they not place God as an idle Spectatour, yea a ſervile Attender of the wills ſelf-determination firſt, and then bring him in as Auxiliarie to its Actions? This is rancide Divinity, yea and Philoſophy too. Do they not fall directly into that Opinion of <hi>Origen</hi> confuted by <hi>Thomas,</hi> againſt the Gentiles, thus. <hi>Certain men not underſtanding</hi>

And from hence the Opinion of ſome ſeemeth to have proceeded, who ſaid, Providence was not concerned in thoſe things which related to Free will, that is, Elections; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal matters only—who are confuted by that one place of</hi> Eſay, <hi>Thou</hi>

                        <hi>alſo hath wrought all our works in us.</hi> Whether theſe words of the Prophet may not be eluded, I will not diſpute, but they plainly declare that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Thomas</hi> his mind, All our inward motions as well as outward acts and effects, are governed by God. For the immediate concurſe of God being generally granted by Philoſophical Divines, neceſſary to the Act of limited and neceſſary cauſes, whoſe principle is more certain and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative then Free Agents are; What honeſt or ſober doubt can be made of the immediate hand of God in moving the will free, and void
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55232:190"/>
of ſuch natural Laws and Propentions, as irrational Agents are compelled by? There ſeems much leſs uſe of it here, than there. It may be, they fear Gods hand ſhould light ſo heavy upon the will of Man, as to hurt the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of it. Which were to be feared indeed, if God ſo concurred with Free Agents, as with Natural; and proportioned not his Influences agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſubject; but ſurely God worketh not ſo rudely: Or if the Act of God, being as natural to the Creature, as its own, yea unſeparable from that of the Creature, were not a <hi>Total</hi> cauſe together with the Creatures, of ſuch Elections.

From whence we conclude, the Grace of God is not given in a common manner, or compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, to leave the will ſtill ſeparately, without particular excitations and prae-motions, effectually and immutably (as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaks) inclining it to embrace Chriſt exhibited in the Means of Grace: And that no man ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally cauſes himſelf to differ from another in electing good: But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the like proportion of Grace given to two perſons equally, otherwiſe qualified, the reaſon why one refuſes the Good and chooſes the Evil, is not to be taken from the meer uſe of the Freedom of Will, by one better than another, of himſelf; and improving that ſtock of Grace given of God, by his own ſtrength better than his Fellow, but becauſe the Grace of God, beſides the common ſtock, moves one more particularly than it doth the other.</p>

Therefore it becomes them who object this no leſs then us, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the difficulty.

But to this purpoſe we have ſpoken before.</p>
                     <p>But to excuſe God from double dealing with Man, in that he exacts that of reprobated perſons who cannot act obediently to it as they are required, for want of his neceſſary aſſiſtance, there is brought into great uſe, and not lately neither, the diſtinction of [<hi>Voluntas Beneplaciti</hi> and <hi>Signi</hi>] a will of <hi>Good-pleaſure,</hi> and a will of <hi>Sign;</hi> or a will Signified, and a will Concealed:
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55232:191"/>
a ſecret will, and revealed: which indeed are very untowardly and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly deviſed. For if they would ſpeak intelligibly, they ſhould rather have called that revealed Will <hi>Signum Voluntatis,</hi> than <hi>Voluntas Signi:</hi> becauſe it can be no other then an intimation of Gods Will. And if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely they would ſpeak, they ſhould not have made the manifeſtation of Gods Will by ſigns or otherwiſe, a diſtinct will from his ſecret Will, of which it is an Indication. Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> therefore perhaps ſupecting this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie diſtinguiſhes to the ſame effect, but more artificially, between <hi>Voluntas Praecepti,</hi> and <hi>Voluntas Propoſiti, a Will of Precept,</hi> and <hi>a Will of Purpoſe</hi> in God anſwering the contradictions contained in the Objection above made by the help of it: For, ſayes he to <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins,</hi> the oppoſition were plain and real if God had decreed and purpoſed with himſelf one thing, and decreed another thing to Man; but this we find not. But it is no contradiction for God to decree one thing, as that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould deny his Maſter, and to give out a command to the contrary, that he ſhould not deny him. By this means indeed he anſwers the Logical contradiction of terms and propoſition, very ſufficiently, and no more: but he does not take off the moral oppoſition and inconſiſtencie of the things themſelves. For may not a man be ſaid to croſs and contrary himſelf, who ſhall reſolve to revenge himſelf on his Adverſary, and in the mean time gives him good words, and perhaps adviſe to beware of him? As when a man ſayes to him he owes and intends a miſchief, <hi>Take heed, look to your ſelf, I ſhall meet with you, I will be even with you.</hi> Theſe words ſpoken ſeriouſly would be very ridiculous, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man at the ſame time, ſhould kindly admoniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his reſolution and purpoſe: and taken otherwiſe, agreeable to the falſe nature of Man who may diſſemble, but not to the Majeſty and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God: who needs no ſuch arts to fetch in his enemies. Certainly therefore God doth ſeriouſly intend not to puniſh when he threatens, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath obſerved, and intend ſeriouſly to ſave when he warns. But whom? All thoſe that are in the noiſe of ſuch Precepts or Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If indeed Gods Word were preached, and his Will revealed as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to impenitent and incorrigible men to whom he hath no ſuch real pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as to ſave them, then might he be ſubject to like accuſations, as men are, who particularly apply themſelves to their enemies: but ſo God dealeth not with the wicked, whom he rejecteth, or denyeth efficacious Grace to. For (as hath been ſaid) the Promiſes of God, and Precepts, and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not in the ſecret or expreſs Will of God ordained for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate primarily, but indirectly only, and as mixed and indiſcernible to the Meſſengers of God, from the Righteous. And however the ſucceſs in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to the wicked anſwers not the intention of the Inſtrument, Man; yet ſuch zealous endeavours by Man, never go unrewarded by God: and ſo it is not in vain in the Lord. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks appoſitely, <hi>What if ſome</hi>

                     <p>To recollect therefore what hath paſſed on this ſubject: the ſeveral Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Gods favour to loſt Man may be ſaid to be theſe. Firſt, by an abſolute irreſpective Act of Grace, he determined to re-enter into Covenant with Man for his Reſtauration. Secondly, he ordained this Covenant to be in the hands of his Son, as Mediatour. Thirdly, that his Son by taking humane Nature, ſhould accompliſh in Mans behalf, whatever was required by Gods Juſtice of him. Fourthly, that the effect and benefits of Chriſts
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55232:191"/>
Death and Paſſion ſhould not inconditionately and immediately be made over unto all, but by the means and conveyance of Faith working by Love and Obedience. Fifthly, that this Obedience of Faith ſhould not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow upon the propounding of Chriſt crucified to the Ear, but by the inſpiration of Grace into the ſoul, opening the door of the heart as it did <hi>Lyddia</hi>'s, to let in Chriſt as well with his ſanctifying as ſatisfying Graces.

The ſoul of Man being maimed and diſabled by his Fall, muſt have a Grace to cure and reſtore the broken ſtate thereof, before outward means can avail to the enabling it to be obedient, and to perform acts of a new and ſpiritual Life: adding, That it would be all one for to offer Grace to the ſoul of man ſo diſeaſed, as it would be to offer a pair of Spectacles to a blind man, or a ſtaff to him whoſe leggs be broken. And I wonder much to find him charged by a very learned Authour of late, that he hath not given us the true efficient cauſe of the wills of obedience, wherein (as he well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) conſiſteth the principal difficulty of all, but only the Formal, and wherein the efficacie of Grace conſiſteth.

                        <p> Of the effect and benefit of Chriſts Mediation in ſuffering and riſing again, ſeen in the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Man.

                     </argument>
                     <p>OF the Juſtification and Sanctification of a man by Chriſt, we have heretofore ſpoken: it remains now, for the Concluſion of this Firſt Part, that we here ſpeak of the moſt perfect, and noble effect of Chriſts mediation ſeen in the ſalvation of Man, or his ſtate of perfect Reſtitution in bliſs; to which, Grace here in this life is but a Prelude and an Introduction. And to this end, the immediate way hereunto, the Reſurrection, is to be explained, as a principle Article of Chriſtian Faith. For this alſo is an effect of Chriſt our Mediatour, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> witneſſeth in theſe words; <hi>The Reſurrection</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug. Tract. 23. in Joann. <hi>John 6 54.</hi>

                        <hi>of ſouls is effected by the eternal and immutable ſubſtance of Father and Son, but the Reſurrection of the Body is by the temporal, and not co-aeternal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of the humanity of the Son.</hi> And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks well to this<note place="margin">Ambros de Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Reſurrect. Illi quidam qui dicunt animas, &amp;c.</note> purpoſe: <hi>They who think that ſouls are immortal, do not ſufficiently pacifie me; while they redeem me but in part: For what great favour can it be to me, when I am not wholly delivered? What life can that be, if the work of God in me muſt periſh? Where is Gods juſtice, if the ſame natural end be to the juſt and wicked in common?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They that would therefore make ſure work againſt infidelity, bring their grounds for this point, from the Gentiles themſelves; whom they would convert to this opinion. But both the artificial and inartificial ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, reaſon and teſtimony of the moſt famous Philoſophers, not taken from, and grounded upon Divine Revelations, will certainly be found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient. For ſurely it may be ſaid of the profeſſion of this Article of Faith, what Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion of him, <hi>Fleſh and Bloud hath not revealed it unto thee.</hi> For what the Heathen invented of their own heads, concerning the Immortality of the Soul (if that they invented, and not rather received from others, better informed) they ſoon corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which ſolid argument is alſo uſed by <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> ſhewing that becauſe the Body only properly falls to earth, therefore it is the body chiefly we are to believe ſhall be raiſed again: And therefore the Athanaſian and Nicene Creeds as ſupplements to the Apoſtolical, expreſs the body in particular, and the fleſh to be reſtored.</p>
                     <p>And however fair and laudable attempts are made by the Ancients to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade rather then prove a Reſurrection, from the ſeveral prettie Analogies found in nature of things periſhing, and after a while returning again to their priſtine beauty and perfection; yet not to except againſt them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, How can we ſuppoſe they, who knew little of the true God, ſhould underſtand ſo much as Gods people, who had not this revealed in direct terms, but in types and ſhadows, and reſemblances; which have a more litteral and hiſtorical ſenſe than this would be? And it hath exerciſed the Pens of learned men both wayes, to enquire, Whether the Jews generally believe any more than <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> might have learnt of them, a life after the diſſolution of the body, and a ſtate of bliſs, after a juſt and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable life and death in this world: all which, as they prove not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, which is the chief point of Chriſtian Faith. The expreſſions in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> of the Mother expecting to have her children raiſed again; eſpecially taking the Comment of St. <hi>Paul</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Text (as is generally believed) along with it (though it may well be underſtood of thoſe more Canonical Hiſtories relating how the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites ſon was reſtored to Life again by <hi>Eliſha</hi>). And the many divine ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Book of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> do declare a great and glorious prerogative belonging to the Juſt and Righteous above the wicked in the world to come; but what is ſaid may be reſtrained to the Immortality of the Spirit of men; little or no mention being made of the Reſurrection of the Body. Yet in <hi>Eſdras</hi> we have theſe words expreſly; <hi>Whereſoever thou findeſt the</hi>

                        <hi>dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the firſt place in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> But this Book is not received by the Romaniſts themſelves, and in all probality was much later then the reſt: however it may be ſaid to deliver the current opinion of that Church then. And in <hi>Maccabees</hi> there<note place="margin">2 Macc. 7. 14.</note> is mention made of being raiſed again, and of a Reſurrection, which (as is ſaid) muſt relate to the Body fallen. And in the ſame Book, He that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Chap. 12. 43.</note> for the dead is commended, <hi>in that he was mindful of the Reſurrection.</hi> But none convince us more of a Catholick opinion amongſt the Jews, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved doubtleſs as a Tradition from their Fathers, and ſuppoſed to their more expreſs preſcriptions in Gods worſhip, then that of <hi>Martha</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt day.</hi> And now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes<note place="margin">John 11. 24.</note> the Jews are ſo well ſettled in the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, that they envie the faith of it to any but themſelves, ſaying, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath it;<note place="margin">Buxt. Synag. cap. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>There are four things which the Iſralites have from God in eſpecial manner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Nations: The Land of Canaaenan; The Law; Propheſie, and The Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> But in my judgment, St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts it out of all queſtion that the Jews believed of old a Reſurrection, and that of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; of which we now ſpeak. For thus in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles he<note place="margin">Acts 24. 15.</note> ſpeaks; <hi>And have hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo allow that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this Doctrine ſeemed ſo eſſential to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that without it all Chriſtian Faith were loſt: as appears out of that moſt ſublime and eloquent
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:55232:193"/>
Chapter concerning it to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> where, firſt he layes down his<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> ground of Chriſtian Faith, Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, as that, upon which all other Articles are founded, and without which all preaching and<note place="margin">v. 2.</note> all Faith would be in vain. And from hence he infers at leaſt a poſſibility that our bodies being of fleſh and bloud, of the ſame nature, ſhall alſo riſe again: And that Chriſts Reſurrection was but as the firſt fruits to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt<note place="margin">20.</note> or vintage; which in order muſt neceſſarily follow. And having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and confirmed the truth, he anſwers the objections which may ſeem to diſprove it; which method we here chooſe briefly to imitate and follow.<note place="margin">35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tertul. Adver. Marc. l. 5. c. 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And firſt, we argue from the term Reſurrection which muſt needs imply ſomewhat fallen or doſſolved, as is ſaid: as <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion</hi> doth affirm.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From the Example of Chriſt, the exemplary cauſe of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. For according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> diſputation at large, there is the<note place="margin">v. 12, 13.</note> ſame reaſon for the Reſurrection of us, as of Chriſt. But Chriſts body was raiſed up in that individual ſubſtance that was laid in the Grave, and therefore muſt ours likewiſe: And this is it which is affirmed and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians. For if we believe that Jeſus dyed</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>and roſe again, even us alſo, which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi> And no doubt can be made but Chriſt had fleſh and bloud, after his Reſurrection, the ſigns and marks ſhow'd to that purpoſe, convincing not only incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Thomas,</hi> but all of like difficulty of Faith.<note place="margin">Luke 24. 19. John 20. 27.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It appeareth from the compariſon made by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, As in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. But</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 22, 23.</note> 
                        <hi>every one in his own order,</hi> &amp;c. But in <hi>Adam</hi> all men died corporally, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Chriſt ſhall all be raiſed corporally, or in their own bodies: as <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertull. ubi ſupra.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If immortality be promiſed to this body, then muſt this body ariſe, and not another: But to this mortal body is promiſed immortality; therefore, it muſt riſe, becauſe there is no imaginable way to have that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but by a Reſurrection. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>This corruptible muſt put on</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>ib.</hi> v. 53.</note> 
                        <hi>incorruption; and this mortal muſt put on immortality.</hi> And what can we ſuppoſe the Apoſtle aimed at in thoſe words, but his own fleſh and others? <hi>And how ſhall they that are in the Graves hear Chriſts voice,</hi> as he ſaith in St. <hi>John, unleſs they be raiſed by him?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 5. 28.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, An argument may be drawn from the truth and juſtice of God, copiouſly proſecuted by the ancient Fathers and their Followers, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves upon the word of God, which ſaith, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every man may receive the things done in his</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil.</hi> But without<note place="margin">Iniquu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> enim Deus ſi non per id punitur quis, aut juvatur, per quod opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt. <hi>Id. Tert. cap. 12.</hi>
                        </note> the Reſurrection of the body, this diſtribution of Juſtice cannot be made. And ſo, what will become of thoſe new and bold Philoſophers, and their Dogmes unchriſtian, who liberally grant (and this is more than we have reaſon to expect from them) that there ſhall be a ſpecial time of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things (and ſo the ſoul ſhall enter again into a body) but not that individual ſubſtance, which before was united to it; but yet one, making the ſame individual Perſon which was before: And how ſo? Why, the Form, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is, all and all, as to the conſtituting the ſame thing: and therefore, it alone can denominate a man the ſame, though the matter be various. But how then can it be ſaid with any truth, that every man ſhall give an account for what he hath done in ſuch a body, when, according to this ſacrilegious phanſie, it is not the ſame, but another body?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:55232:193"/>Laſtly, Such as was the Reſurrection of men miraculouſly wrought in the Old and New Teſtament, is to be the Reſurrection, in ſubſtance, the laſt day. But the child raiſed by <hi>Eliſah;</hi> and that other by <hi>Eliſha:</hi> And the<note place="margin">1 Kings 17. 23 2 Kings 4. 34. cap. 13. 21. Matth. 27. 52.</note> man riſing to life, who was caſt upon the bones of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> and all thoſe raiſed by Chriſt, in his life time, and at his death: When the dead bodies of the Saints aroſe out of their graves, aroſe all in their bodies in which they dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore ſurely ſuch is our Reſurrection to be.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe there remain ſome ſore objections to be cleared before Faith can have its perfect work on Chriſtian minds, I ſhall not expatiate, contrary to my general purpoſe to anſwer all; but only that which is all; and that out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> words thus rendered: <hi>But there are ſome</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chriſt. in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> Sern. 7. Eth.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>that disbelieve this thing, becauſe they are ignorant of God. For pray tell me, which is the eaſier of the two, to bring a thing out of nothing, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore again things that have been diſſolved? But what ſay they? They ſay, ſuch a man hath ſuffered ſhipwrack and is drown'd, and ſo fallen, many fiſhes have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd him, and every one hath eat ſome part of thoſe fiſhes. Afterward, of thoſe very fiſhes ſome were taken in one haven, and ſome in another, and eaten of others. And again, theſe men that have eaten theſe fiſhes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the man happen to dye in other Countries, and that perhaps devoured by wild beaſts. Such a confuſion and diſſipation being made, how ſhall that man riſe again? Who is he that reduces the duſt again? But why, O man, doſt thou thus ſpeak? and patches a long train of tales together, and offereſt it as inſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? For anſwer me: What if that man doth not go to Sea, and be not drownd? If no fiſh eat him? nor the fiſh be afterward eaten of infinite men, but that he be laid decently in his Coffin, and neither worms nor any thing elſe moleſt him: How ſhall that duſt and aſhes be compacted together again? Whence ſhall that body flouriſh again? Is not this unanſwerable? If they be Greeks [Heathens] who doubt of theſe things, We can anſwer a thouſand things. But what? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſome amongſt them who put ſouls into Plants, and Fruit-trees, and Doggs. Tell me which is eaſier for a ſoul to recover its own body, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Again, there are others who ſays that fire ſhall catch them, that their garments ſhall ariſe, and their ſhooes; and no body laughs at them. And ſome introduce Atomes. But we have nothing to ſay to them. But to Believers, if we may call them believers who thus doubt, we ſhall ſay with the Apoſtle, All life is ſubject to corruption, all plants, all ſeeds. Seeſt thou not,</hi> &amp;c. Here that eloquent Father expatiates in the myſteries and ſubtilties of nature, ſhewing how little we underſtand of them, and concludes this point thus: <hi>But theſe things humane reaſon is to ſeek in. But when God works all things yield to him.</hi> In another place he doubts, whether he be an Infidel or Chriſtian, who calls in queſtion the Reſurrection: and the reaſon hereof is, becauſe, as the power of God is infinite, ſo infinite wayes there are for his infinite wiſdome to bring to paſs his own pleaſure, and to make good his words, in which he hath cauſed his ſervants to truſt.</p>

                        <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead: To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time.</hi> But before we engage far in this ſubject of Salvation, it is requiſite we obſerve a twofold Salvation frequently mentioned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in Scripture: A <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal.</hi> For herein common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes have ſurpriſed many, who willing to amplifie and extend all the promiſes of Gods deliverance, equally to us of this laſt Age of the Church, and to them of the former, and Apoſtolical, do willingly interpret many places of Scripture peculiar to them, as concerning us to: which cannot be literally done; though figuratively it may. For the Church of Chriſt being in thoſe firſt Ages in continual conflicts with her enemies, Jewiſh and Gentile; and moſt violent perſecntions harraſſing and waſting the tender body of the Infant-Church, many weak Chriſtians were of deſponding minds, and looked upon the ſame as <hi>Job</hi> upon natural man, as having a ſhort time to live, and full of ſorrows: Which moved the Apoſtolical Writers to confirm the Hope and Faith of them by the aſſurances of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55232:194"/>
and ſalvation. And none can deny this to be the literal meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his eighth Chapter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> from whence ſo many draw an Argument to prove the innumerable purpoſe of God towards particular perſons, in predeſtinating and electing and glorifying them; when, upon faithful examination, nothing more was primarily intended then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods temporal preſervation of the Church, and making it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly glorious in deſpight of all its adverſaries: ſo that none ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the flook of Chriſt ſo far <hi>from the love of Chriſt, by perſecution, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, diſtreſs, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword; but that, at length, it ſhould be more than conquerer, through him that loved it. And that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor things to come,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould cauſe God to forſake it. And no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the meaning of the ſame Apoſtle in his thirteenth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>And that knowing the time, that now it is high</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>time for us to awake out of ſleep, for now is our ſalvation nearer than when we believed; i. e.</hi> having continued thus long in the faith, the time now draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth near, we ſhould be ſecured and ſaved from our enemies. And the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be revealed in the laſt times</hi> ſpoken of by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, which, at laſt, ſhould be manifeſted to the Church; in conſtant expectation of which they were kept by Faith and confidence of Gods mercy. And if we ſhall conſult the Apocalypſe, we ſhall ſcarce find the word <hi>Salvation</hi> uſed in any other ſenſe then that of temporal deliverance<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 10. 12, 10. 19, 1.</note> of Gods Church. But withal, moſt certain it is, that by <hi>Salvation,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often indended by Gods word, the deliverance from the miſeries of ſin, and ſuffering in this world, into a ſtate of ſuch perfect bliſs, as man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: in which ſenſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                        <hi>salvation.</hi> And that, <hi>with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation;</hi> which ſalvation was, in thoſe dayes, the deſtruction of them that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt. For St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to animate the weak Believers to a ſtout and reſolute profeſſion of Chriſt, againſt the terrors of death, threatning thoſe that were known to be Chriſtians, tells them; that if they ſo boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt with their mouth as to dye in that profeſſion, they ſhould be ſaved. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>work out their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>with fear and trembling,</hi> he means, without doubt, Eternal Life. And that Eternal Life which, to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he calleth <hi>the Gift of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. ult. 1 John 5. 11. Col. 3. 3, 4.</note> Of which Life St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>This is the record that God hath given unto us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Coloſſians: For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt: When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> So that nothing is more frequent in Scripture then that Chriſt is the Authour of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him: as it is in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and that he is the <hi>Authour and finiſher of our Faith;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 5. 9. 12. 2.</note> The Authour of it, in Grace; and Finiſher of it, in Glory; the perfection and conſummation of Grace. Of the thing therefore, no diſpute can be juſtly raiſed, but of the manner, ſome differences there are; and they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally about the poſſeſſion of that bliſs, or the fruition of it; or, the time when it firſt entred into, and, when it is in its full perfection.</p>
                     <p>And as touching the latter, it is with greateſt probability affirmed, That, although there be ſuch a free and full participation of the Divine Viſion, whereby the Spirits of the deceaſed and truly and abundantly happy, yet there remains ſomewhat to be added thereunto, from the conjunction of the body, once companion to the ſoul, in all good and evil, of the paſſed Life.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55232:195"/>
For as at the general Reſurrection the ſouls of the damned ſhall have their torments augmented upon the re-union of the body, once combining with the ſoul in ſin; ſo at the ſame time, there being a conjunction of the ſoul and body of the juſt, there ſhall likewiſe be an increaſe of felicity and glory. St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth thus much where he ſaith, <hi>Knowing that whatever good</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>thing a man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> And yet more particularly to the <hi>Corinthians: For we muſt all appear</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> So that the body, as well as the ſoul, ſhall have the like proportion of reward or retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, as they had in ſinning, or doing well together. Of which we forbear here to enlarge, as not at all queſtioning the vertue and ſufficiencie of Chriſts merits, as the ſonner ſeems to do.</p>
                     <p>For if the Grace of Gods Spirit, the courſe of righteouſneſs duly run, by the ſervant of God, the Merits of Chriſts Death and Paſſion be not effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to the throughly purging of the ſoul and conſcience of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this life, ſomewhat derogatory, not to the perſon only of man, but performance of Gods Spirits, and Chriſts merit applyed certainly to the ſoul, ſeems to be reflected. The ſufficiencie of Chriſts ſalvation is ſuch, that, by confeſſion of all, it may avail to the acquitting from all the affections and circumſtances of ſin, ſuch as pollution, guilt, and puniſhment; but it will not be granted that this actually is done in this life, or were ordained to ſuch an end generally: For I ſuppoſe that they who have raiſed and maintained ſuch an opinion, do not deny the ſufficiencie of Chriſts merits, and Gods mercy to ſanctifie every faithful perſon, to the putting him into a capacity of heaven, and that immediately after this life; for they directly affirm, that ſome eminent Saints, and particularly Martyrs for Chriſt, do forthwith paſs from hence to abſolute bliſs; but they deny that all that are in a ſtate of Grace, and are predeſtinated by God unto everlaſting life, are ſo fully cleanſed from the contagion and impurities, which even Venial ſins taint them with, that they need not another expurgation before they can be admitted into the preſence of God.</p>
                     <p>The faith of the ancient Churches (as in few words we ſhall ſhew) and of all, but ſuch as profeſs ſubjection unto the Roman, hold that though no man ordinarily lives without ſin, nor at the inſtant of his death is ſo abſolutely pure, as to be fit to behold the face of God, who can endure no iniquity, and with whom no unclean thing ſhall dwell; yet by paſsing from this life into another, ſo far is the evil remitted by Gods mercie in Chriſt, ſo far accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt, is that perſon that dyes in a ſtate of Grace, and reconciled to God, that he paſſes immediately from this mortal and miſerable ſtate here, to an immortal and leſs miſerable, yea bleſſed, though not to the height, yet far exceeding all happineſs competible to the children of God, during this life.</p>
                     <p>The demonſtration of this our opinion, though very true, we muſt confeſs to be difficult, by reaſon of an evaſion and ſhift always at hand, to elude our proofs. For when we bring teſtimonies direct out of Scripture of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Gods ſervants after this life; they anſwer preſently, that they are to be underſtood either of eminent Saints, which are preſently accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods preſence; or of their deſignation to bliſs, though they be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently poſſeſſed of it; which muſt be acknowledged to be a kind of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, compared at leaſt, with the wickeds condition, which after death is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable. But theſe notwithſtanding, and certain others, we ſhall take notice of by and by, we declare poſitively, that for this doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55232:195"/>
there is not any ground of Scriptures, Reaſon, or Antiquity: but on the contrary, all theſe are ſufficient evidences to the contrary. For if the thing be ſo material a point in our Religion, as it is ſaid to be, we hold the Scripture to be ſo entire a Rule of our belief, as that it muſt of neceſsity have been contained in it: but there is no foundation in it for that, as we ſhall ſee by and by. And on the other ſide, there are theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in it, againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>might, for there is no word or deviſe, nor wiſdom nor knowledge in the grave, whether thou goeſt.</hi> Doth not this place plainly ſpeak of the fixt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable eſtate of the life to come? And can that be connted leſs than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous which is anſwer'd at the beſt rate, That there is nothing that a man can better himſelf in; but others, by their piety, may better them? Or that though in Purgatory they cannot help themſelves, yet by the good works done before they came there, they may be benefitted? Who denyes but the Faith and Good works of men in this life, have ſingular influence upon mens future life, to the encreaſe of happineſs?. But all this, we ſay, takes effect immediately upon the change of this mortal into immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtate. For who told them, that, to the application of the work to the wages are required the ſuffrages of the living, or paſsions of the dead?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> clears this, ſaying, <hi>Write, bleſſed</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>are the dead which dye in the Lord from henceforth, for they reſt from their labour, and their works follow them.</hi> Their works follow them, without the leaſt mention or inſinuation of being vegetated and enabled ſo to do with the prayers of the living. And <hi>they reſt from their labours,</hi> without being toyled, waſted, and tormented with worſe miſeries than ever they ſuffered upon earth. The evaſion which is here borrowed from <hi>Anſelme,</hi> upon the words (which yet in truth are no more <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s than the Comments under his name upon the Epiſtles, but <hi>Herveus Natalis</hi> his, living above two hundred years after <hi>Anſelme) that here we are to underſtand the time of the Reſurrection,</hi> might be accepted (for true it is, then ſhall the due reward be rendered to every mans works) if this excluded the other: For let our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſay whether all conſideration of good works be deferred until the Reſurrection? Is it not in reference to them that ſome men are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Purgatory only, while others immediately go to hell? That ſome mens pains in Purgatory are gentle and light, others more grievous? and ſome mens ſhorter, and ſome longer, even of themſelves without the help of their friends upon earth? Why then muſt we needs underſtand this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good works to be at the day of Judgment only, and not in juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the whole time going before? And therefore is that eluſion we touched, of being meant of perfect Men and Martyrs, only reſted on as the ſurer of the two, and that from <hi>De Victore</hi> and <hi>Haymon.</hi> It is true he doth ſpeak of ſuch: but it can only be ſaid, and not proved, that he ſpeaks of ſuch only. <hi>Dying in the Lord</hi> being of far greater extent, and not upon mens pleaſures, and the exigencie of a corrupt cauſe limited. But diſtruſt that theſe deviſes will not ſatisfie, hath driven a great Champion of this Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into another plainer, but much more abſurd anſwer of his own; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome men dye abſolutely in the Lord, as Martyrs, &amp;c. and ſome men partly in the Lord, and partly not in the Lord: This is congruous indeed to the opinion reſolved to be maintained; and belike, St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> gives ground hereunto: who in a certain Epiſtle ſaith that ſome men in this life are partly the Sons of Chriſt, and partly the Sons of this
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55232:196"/>
world. This <hi>Auguſtine</hi> might ſpeak, in reference to the imperfection of the ſtate of Grace and Sonſhip here, which will admit of ſome mixture of worldlineſs and weakneſs, with Grace and Sanctification; but doth St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> any where ſay, that, upon this any man is partly the child of God, and partly the child of the Devil, at the ſame time? or that at the ſame time he is in a ſtate of Grace and a ſtate of Sin? or reconciled to God, and not reconciled? This is a new invention; but very ſuitable to the third ſtate after this life, Purgatory, and both of equal truth.</p>
                     <p>The place of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes—Where the tree falleth there it ſhall be,</hi> brought againſt a middle ſtate, I confeſs hath beſides the moſt natural ſenſe, a ſenſe which may be aimed at, beſides the denyal of any middle ſtate, but that by indifferent interpreters it hath been applyed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutableneſs of mans ſtate, at his death, is certain. For in truth Purgatory, as commended to us, is a quite different ſtate from that of bliſs: as a ſtate of torment muſt be from a ſtate of bliſs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Holy Scriptures teach us that; <hi>The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 1. 7. John 5. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>cleanſeth us from all our ſins:</hi> and that <hi>He that heareth Chriſts word, and believeth on him that ſent him, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into death, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> And we may note, that <hi>Life</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply taken, is never uſed for any other ſtate but that of happineſs, in holy Scripture: and therefore theſe two ſtates only being mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is ſufficient to conclude that no more are to be added. For were it ſo, that nothing in Scripture were directly ſpoken againſt this opinion, it would no more avail the defenders of it, then it would any other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Invention, which might be yet framed without any direct oppoſition from thence.</p>
                     <p>Now the Scriptural reaſons againſt this we make to be theſe, in brief. Firſt, that as well Scripture, as Philoſophy, to which they aſſent who intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe Purgative Flames, truly hold that all ſpiritual purgation and ſanctification muſt have the conſent and co-operation of the will, to produce any ſpiritual effect in the ſoul: but the Will after death elects not, merits not, nor demerits, <hi>i. e.</hi> deſerves neither good nor evil, but is fixed to the ſtate in which it is. But if ſin be remaining in the ſeparate ſoul, it muſt neceſſarily have its ſeat principally in the will; which is the formal principle of all good and evil. And there can be no change in the will of the deceaſed, as to the choiſe of good or evil ſimply; but only as to the more full and abſolute captivating of the ſame, in the admiration of good or pertinacie in evil. Therefore the Prayers of the living not having, any influence upon the will or affections, at that time, to change them for the beſt, or correct the pravity of them, cannot avail to the meliorating of the ſoul in reference to its ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity or impurity.</p>
                     <p>Again, No corporeal cauſe can be effectual upon the ſpirit of Man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, while it is disjoyned from the body, to the cleanſing of ſpiritual ſtains: But the relicts of ſin are ſpiritual and not corporal pollutions; and therefore no flames of Purgatory can mundifie the ſoul, ſo as to render it more innocent and fit for heaven. But the flames of Purgatory are ſenſible and properly material. And it is not ſaid that the ſuffrage of the living obtain remiſſion of ſins for the afflicted in Purgatory, but only deliver them from puniſhments there ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, All ſins being committed in the perſon of a Man conſiſting of body and ſoul, muſt be accounted for as they were acted in the Perſon, and not only in the one Part of him: neither can any
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55232:196"/>
ſin be ſaid to be forgiven the ſoul, without the body, which was committed in ſoul and body together: nor can the ſoul be purged, and not the perſon, nor the perſon and not the body; but the body lies unconcerned &amp; untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this while, by ſuch tormenting remedies; and therefore there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of any ſuch ſemi-purgation of the ſoul, which ſhould avail to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and ſalvation of the whole. And therefore the ſouls of the damned ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the pains of Hell fire, immediately after their departure from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are not awhit the better for what they ſuffer. Neither can this be alledged to invalidate the other, becauſe, that in God puniſhing the ſouls of the Reprobates without their bodies, is no unjuſtice, but rather a favour, deferring the puniſhment of it (who might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted it upon both preſently) until his own appointed time. But it can neither be underſtood nor believed, how that pravity, ſhot, or guilt, which equally infflicted both parts of man, ſhould be removed and cleared upon the ſuffering of one, or applications made to it only.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All ſatisfactions muſt be proportionable to the wrong and offence in the ſubject, at leaſt, if not manner of them. But Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes are committed in the body as well as ſoul: Therefore muſt the ſatisfaction likewiſe be anſwerable, if at all made; and there is no ground to ſuppoſe that God ſhould aſſign any ſuch remedy of perſonal errour, which concern one part of man only.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Either a man dyes in Repentance or Impenitencie: If in Impenitencie, then he hath no benefit of Purgatory, according to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts: If in true Repentance, then are all his ſins ſo far cleanſed and remitted, that there is no need at all of Purgatory: which is apparent from the very nature of Repentance: which is generally agreed to be a <hi>Second Baptiſm:</hi> Now, as Baptiſm waſheth away all ſin originally, ſo that the perſon dying inſtantly upon it, directly paſſes to Heaven; in like manner muſt it be in the Baptiſm of Repentance; all actual ſins muſt be forgiven, and none remain to be puniſhed or purged.</p>
                     <p>This is granted with this exception, provided we take Repentance entirely, in all its parts; whereof ſatisfaction (they ſay) is one; which being not thoroughly made on earth, muſt be compleated in Purgatory. But to this (paſſing by the diſpute of ſatisfaction which is corrupted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly by the ſame perſons) we anſwer as before, that all ſatisfaction<note place="margin">In Purgaterio non poſſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas mereri aut peccare. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. de Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. lib. 2. c. 2.</hi>
                        </note> which can be accepted, muſt be attended with the change of the Will of the perſon, and be an act of the perſon; and therefore this called <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> in Purgatory being no act, and having no concurrence of the Will of the Perſon, the body being ſeparate from the ſoul, can no wayes ſupply the defects of ſatisfaction in this world: and therefore if there be any, it muſt be before the divorce of body and ſoul. Whereupon St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 54.</note> (who is confidently, but vainly alledged as a Patron of this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory fire) ſaith thus: <hi>Furthermore there is no place of amending man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners but in this life: for hereafter every man ſhall have what he in this life procured to himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now in brief to take notice of the grounds maintaining the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, we anſwer firſt to the Scriptures, which <hi>Valentia</hi> makes but four, of any couſiderableneſs; though others, by Metaphors and Allegories, multiply them to no purpoſe. Firſt we muſt note, that however the Old Teſtament is made uſe of to confirm this; yet the more ſincere and ſober wholly wave all autorities and examples from thence: and ſo ſhall we. Nay, there are ſome who altogether decline as well the New as Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55232:197"/>
as doth <hi>Petrus Soto,</hi> not finding any thing to the purpoſe; but would not have us much wonder that nothing appears ſolid for it there, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many things are of Tradition without Scripture. Yet the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and colourable we ſhall try: which are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt <hi>Matthew</hi> the Twelfth, v. 32.—<hi>Whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.</hi> Some ſins are not forgiven in the world to come; therefore ſome are: And that muſt be in Purgatory. This is the ſum of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>But the conſequence is not ſo good as it is taken to be. For it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, by way of emphatical ſpeech and aggravation, to put more into an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument than is really and ſtrictly intended for true: as may by and by appear from ſuch another Inſtance. But not to deny the validity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe anſwers given to it, I hold it beſt to make ſhort work with it, and taking the word <hi>World,</hi> as meaning no more than to inſinuate unto us, what in many other places the New Teſtament doth, a twofold Age of the Church of God; one under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other under the Law of Chriſt. And plainly tells the ſpiteful and malicious Jews, that they whoſo reproachfully and incredulouſly ſpake of the Spirit of Grace manifeſting it ſelf to the world in miracles, could not expect to be forgiven ſuch a notorious ſin, either by vertue of the Law or Goſpel; which then began to be publiſhed. And this ſtate of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle calls <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to come,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> And the like diſcrimination<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 7.</note> doth he make in that place to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> if we compare his words in the ſixth Chapter with them in the tenth, where he declareth againſt a<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. 10. 26.</note> poſſibility of ſalvation to ſuch, who, when they <hi>have once been illuminated and taſted the good things of heaven, if they ſhall fall away</hi> [from their Baptiſm and profeſſion of the Faith, in which they were once initiated and baptiſed] <hi>to reſtore them again by repentance.</hi> For to them remains no more Sacrifice for ſins. By which he means not, as ſome have thought, that one hath apoſtatiſed from the Chriſtian Faith, could never be reſtored again to Repentance, and become a good Chriſtian, and in a poſſibility of ſalvation; but as <hi>Eulogius Alexandrinus</hi> in <hi>Photius</hi> hath it very literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Phot. Bibl.</note> and well. Such an one returning unto the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> after he was enlightened or baptiſed, could not poſſibly hope for any Sacrifice there which ſhould cleanſe him from his ſins. For though there was a poſſibility of ſalvation in the Law before Chriſt, to ſuch as never were enlightened to the embracing of the Goſpel, yet after Chriſt, ſuch as became Chriſtians and relapſed into Judaiſm, could not have any benefit from it: becauſe they do in effect deny Chriſt, by whom they ſhould be ſaved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Text from whence <hi>Valentia</hi> would fetch Purgatory, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> too (whom we here principally examine) is that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians. Every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt: For the day ſhall</hi>

to be founded hereon: and I might ſpare any farther trouble, but yet ſhall put in my opinion of them; which I take to be grounded upon theſe two things; firſt, the moſt apt connexion between it and the context before and following theſe words. For it is moſt certain that the Apoſtles aim was to diſcover and oppoſe falſe teachers, ſtart up to the prejudice of the true Apoſtles of Chriſt, and laying at leaſt in ſhew another foundation of faith<note place="margin">v. 10, 11.</note> than Chriſt had laid; or building otherwiſe upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> foundation than became them. Now what think we? doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> abruptly leave the ſubject he was treating of, and the perſons he was confuting of, and warning the Corinthians againſt, and paſs to the Doctrine nothing at all depending upon what went before or after, of Purgatory? Or if he did not altogether deſert his ſubject, but (as may be granted by them) declare what would be the end of ſuch Doctours or Doctrines after they were all dead and gone, would this ſatisfie the expectation of ſuch who ſtood in need of preſent advice and directions to ſecure themſelves from ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures? Surely no. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore doth certainly in this Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical or Allegorical manner apply himſelf to the preſent ſtate of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> whom he adviſeth to beware of ſuch dangerous teachers. And how doth he this? Firſt, under the Metaphor of a Workman, inſinuating the teacher himſelf. Secondly, under the Metaphor of a piece of Work, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring the Doctrines taught and inſtilled into men. Thirdly, by <hi>Fire,</hi> certifying the manner of diſcerning the true Doctrine from the falſe: and that fire is afflictions and perſecutions, which then were actually on the Church, but were ſoon after like to fall more heavily on it. Fourthly, by <hi>hay, ſtubble, wood,</hi> he means corrupt and erroneous Doctrines; by <hi>gold, ſilver, precious ſtones,</hi> ſincere and ſound Doctrine. Now collect we all into one, and can any man deſire any plainer and more current conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie between the figurative ſpeech (as moſt infallibly this is) and the proper intention of the Apoſtle. I have begun amongſt you, O<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to preach Chriſt, I have lald the foundation of ſaving Faith, like a wiſe Maſter-builder: yet there are ſome who building partly upon my Doctrine, and partly laying another foundation of their<note place="margin">11.</note> own heads; when in very truth there can be no other foundation laid by any man than that is already laid by me, which is Jeſus Chriſt. Now if any man build upon this foundation thus laid, gold, ſilver,<note place="margin">12.</note> precious ſtones, wood, hay, ſtubble; that is, ſound or unſound; ye ſhall know which Doctrine is as gold, ſilver, and precious ſtones, ſound and valuable; and which as wood, hay, and ſtubble; that is, refuſe and corrupt. For the day ſhall declare it. What day? The day of tryal. What tryal? the tryal by fire: for the fire ſhall try e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans work of what ſort it is. But what fire? The fire of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12.</note> or fiery tryal, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks. And this is the ſecond ground of this interpretation, taken from the frequencie of this phraſe, Fire, ſignifying in Scripture no more than afflictions or perſecutions; which may convince us of the true acceptation here. Chriſt in the Goſpel of St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth, and what</hi>

                        <hi>will I, if it be already kindled?</hi> And that this fire was no other than perſecutions and troubles, with which the followers of Chriſt were to contend and ſtruggle, is manifeſt from the following words. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> taking occaſion to ſpeak of thoſe words, ſaith, <hi>Ipſe melius interpretabitur ignis illius qualitatem,</hi> &amp;c.

And no need of any more inſtances to the purpoſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> either to ſhow in general, that Fire in holy Scripture imports afflictions, or that ſo it is here with St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed. Yet the words immediately following agree ſo exactly with it, that it is yet farther put out of queſtion, what ſhould be the meaning of the former; <hi>viz. If any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a reward. If any mans work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs: but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi> That is; if any man hath ſo built upon the foundation, Chriſt Jeſus, as his work abides the tryal, and ſo be found good and laudable, then he ſhall have his due reward for his pains: But if otherwiſe, his work ſhall be burnt: that is, upon tryal not be found as gold and ſilver which cometh out of the fire better and purer: but Perſecutions and Examinations ſhall reveal or manifeſt it to be droſs, vain, and corrupt; then ſhall ſuch an one ſuffer loſs, he ſhall have loſt his labour, and his reputation, yet may we not deſpair of him: For however he be found defective in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, yet himſelf may be ſaved upon his repentance, ſo as by fire: <hi>i. e.</hi> by having paſſed himſelf through ſuch perſecutions as may bring him to the ſincere profeſſion of the Faith, though his erroneous Doctrines periſh, and come to nought. And to this ſenſe of the Apoſtle do I ſtick, though I am not ignorant how diverſly he is interpreted by as well Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as Modern Divines: to whom to be tyed, when they are ſo diſſonant, were too hard meaſure: eſpecially when the ſimplicity of a literal ſenſe offers it ſelf ſo fairly as here: and the greateſt part of the expoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree hereunto.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is not very ſtrange that the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſhould be drawn this way too? <hi>viz. What ſhall they do</hi>

And yet ſome of theſe denyed the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues thus, If there be no Reſurrection of the dead, to what end do they baptize the living inſtead of the dead? what can it avail them, according to their own judgments and opinions?

The plain and ſimple ſenſe therefore ſhall ſuffice to ward off all force againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt meant no more than they who made not their peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God before they go out of this world, ſhall be caſt into Hell, from whence they ſhall never return until they have paid all the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they ow to God for their ſins, to a farthing, that is, abſolutely ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which by a Periphraſis, or in many words as much as to ſay in one <hi>Never.</hi> Beſides, they that are ſuch ſtout defenders of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> perpetual Virginity againſt the ill ſenſe given by <hi>Helvidius</hi> and his followers of thoſe words in St. <hi>Matthew, Until ſhe had brought forth her Firſt-born;</hi> know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well how to give another ſenſe to <hi>Until,</hi> then a certain inference of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to enſue that Period ſo fix'd: and that it implies not neceſſarily that ever ſuch payment of the utmoſt Farthing ſhall be made: but upon ſuppoſition that it be paid, ſuch event as is there mentioned ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>But Antiquity, and that of both Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches are, is alledged in confirmation of the preſent Roman Purgatory. To which we oppoſe this aſſertion, That Purgatory, as now defended, was never heard of in the Latin Church for four hundred years together after Chriſt, nor received into it with common approbation until ſix hundred years after Chriſt: <hi>Auſtin</hi> began to doubt of it, and is ſcarce conſtant to himſelf in it. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great ſet it up upon its leggs and advanced it far, if ſo be that the Dialogues bearing his name were truly his, as 'tis moſt probable they are not, or that they are corrupted. For how could <hi>Gregory</hi> who flouriſhed about the year of our Lord 590. and was ſucceeded by <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>

But from about that time this erroneous opinion got footing, and began to ſpread, but was never thoroughly ſetled in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf until the time of <hi>John</hi> the Seventeenth, or as others compute it, the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, about the year 1003, when he inſtituted the Feaſt of <hi>All-Souls,</hi> in which men were enjoyned to pray for the deliverance of Souls out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. But the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the year 1439. put it out of all future diſpute, when it decreed it ſo to be. But the Greeks, who were there preſent, refuſed that ſenſe, however they gave way to the Name Purgatory. Neither do they admit it unto this day, ſo vain and bold a task doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> undertake, with other Pontificians to bring (and that of old) the Greek Church to conſent with the Latin herein: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe attempts we find modern Aſſertours of the Roman Cauſe to call them to witneſs too, and when diligent ſearch proves prejudicial to them, to bring <hi>Oſiander</hi> (a man of ſmall judgment, and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his paſſions in his free cenſures of Antiquity, wherever his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory leads him to obſerve any thing there which he likes not, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times underſtands not) and Sir <hi>Edwin Sands,</hi> a Gentleman of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

abilities as an Hiſtorian: but finding the word Purgatory among Grecian Authours of modern times, concluded that it was the ſame with the Roman; but was much miſtaken. For 'tis well known ſome modern Greeks, as <hi>Nilus Theſſalonienſis,</hi> have writ purpoſely againſt the Roman Purgatory.</p>
                     <p>And this will farther appear from the two general defects running through almoſt all the Arguments brought by Romaniſts to prove Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory from the ancient Fathers and Councils of both Churches: which being noted may ſuffice for Anſwers to them in this point, eſpecially in this place. For firſt, they argue from the word Purgatory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they find it in Greek and Latin Fathers. But Purgatory fire with them was quite another thing from that now in credit amongſt us. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> (and he the firſt that we meet with) invented a Purgative fire, and divers Fathers catching at that, diſcourſed dubiouſly upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but with this Fivefold difference from Roman Flames. Firſt, They exempted no man from this Purgation, not Saints or Martyrs, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all ſhould be purged before they entred entirely into Heaven: the moderner Purgatory frees eminent Saints from that fiery tryal. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They held this purgation principally uſeful to the purification of the groſs matter of the body to a finer ſubſtance, before it could be meet to enter into heaven, together with the ſoul: but theſe make it to ſeize principally, if not only, on the ſoul ſeparate from the body, and to cleanſe that. Thirdly, They never intended theirs to purge off the ſtain of ſins, or ſatisfie for what ſouls were behind in, going out of this world; but the Romaniſts affirm and defend it in this ſenſe. Fourthly, They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maintained any immediate purgation or torments from the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoul from the body: but affirmed only a general and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous tranſmutation by Fire, at the Day of Judgment, to be fitted the better for Heaven. Fifthly, They never imagined that the Prayers of Living did relieve the miſeries of the afflicted in Purgatory, as do theſe: or that there was any ſuch paſſing from that ſtate to Heaven before the Day of Judgment. And what need we travel on this ſubject, when we have the teſtimony of chief men againſt them herein? <hi>Rof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſis Artic.</hi> 18. againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> ſays directly, <hi>Amongſt the Ancient there is little or no mention made of Purgatory: and that the Greek to this day hold it not.</hi> The very ſame ſays <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro contr. Haeret. lib. 8. tit. De Indulgentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the ſecond Argument of Romaniſts will clear this, drawn out of many Fathers to prove they held Purgatory becauſe they held Prayer for the dead, of which Prayer none (they ſuppoſe) can be capable, but ſuch as are in this middle ſtate, between Heaven and Hell. But we deny not that the Ancients prayed for the Dead, nor do we diſſent much from them in that pious act our ſelves (however there are quarrellers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, well known by their other affected and moroſe follies, who oppoſe it, becauſe they have no expreſs Scripture for it) but we deny they ever prayed for the pardon of their ſins, or eaſe of torments, ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently; but for an happy reſt and reſtauration in a Reſurrection. So that we peremptorily deny (and well may notwithſtanding all proofs brought to the contrary) that Prayer for the Dead neceſſarily infers Roman Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                     <p>And for the Conſequence of this Opinion of Roman Purgatory, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, it is ſo rank a Corruption, ſuch a novel and impudent inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55232:199"/>
as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under that defection it now is, never did ſo great a miracle as to get it any place in ſober and knowing mens minds; both thing it ſelf, and the abuſe of it being ſuch as alone may ſuffice to diſgrace the Authours of it, and make their pretenſes to infallibility, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies falſe, very ridiculous. We know indeed that ſcarce any thing was of ancienter uſe in the Church then ſome Indulgences, but no more like theſe, than Earth is like Purgatory. Indulgences were made by ſuch who were in autority in the Church towards Penitents, who had their Penances allotted them, for ſcandalous Crimes committed againſt the Faith and Church: which Penances were often relaxed and mittigated by the favour and indulgences of the Fathers of the Church, good cauſe appearing for to do ſo. But that ever it was in the power of the Church to give eaſe to ſuch as were puniſhed in that other Life to come; was never heard of for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thouſand years after Chriſt. <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro</hi> is worth the<note place="margin">Alphonſus de Caſtro lib. 8. Adv. Haer. de Indulg.</note> reading upon this, who is poſitive for Indulgences, but going about to prove them, prepares his Reader with a long Preface for ſuch a ſhort Diſcourſe, telling him that, <hi>He ought not to expect for all points of Faith, Antiquity, or expreſs Scripture. For many things are known to the moderner, which thoſe ancient Writers were altogether ignorant of. For ſeldome any mention is made in ancient Writers of the tranſubſtantiation of the Bread into Chriſts Body: of the Spirits proceeding from the Son, much rarer: of Purgatory, almoſt none at all, eſpecially among Greek Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for which reaſon Purgatory is not believed of the Greek to this day,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>The ancient Church cauſed men to ſatisfie in this life, and would leave nothing to be puniſhed in the Life to come, and therefore there is no mention of Indulgences.</hi> Thus he: But adds, <hi>Amongſt the Romans, the uſe of them is ſaid to be very ancient; as may in ſome manner be collected from their ſtations. And it is reported of</hi> Gregory <hi>the Firſt</hi> [of whom we even now ſpake] <hi>that he granted ſome in his dayes.</hi> It is ſaid and reported: by where, and by whom, he could not tell us. But he tells us indeed how <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, that great Innovator and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church, conſtituted it in the Latherane Council, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Conſtance after that, much; which was not before the Year 1200. Judge we from hence, what great account is to be made of the many ſayings of the Fathers pretended to approve this deviſe. And judge we farther, what great Reaſon or Scripture there is for the Popiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to derogate ſo far as they do, from the efficacy of Gods Holy Spirit of Grace, in the repenting ſinner, though ſtraitened of time in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and demonſtration of his true Converſion; and from the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſts mediation and merits; which are ordained for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſins, upon true Repentance. <hi>For the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John:</hi> and ſo ſay they, underſtood as in this Life and the Life to come: but St. <hi>John,</hi> nor any other holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture, gives us the leaſt intimation of any other ſeaſon of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then that of this Life.</p>
                     <p>Therefore here to end this Firſt Part, with the end of Man in this world, ſeeing Gods Promiſes are ſo liberally revealed unto penitent ſinners in this Life, without exceptions of matter, time, or place, of venial or mortal ſins. Seeing Chriſts merits are abſolutely ſufficient to acquit the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and no limitation is to be found, upon Faith and Repentance, in Scripture; Seeing laſtly, that Gods Spirit of Grace is of vertue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſanctifie, to the waſhing away of all filthineſs both of

                     <hi>worſhip of God ought to be moſt excellent, and pure, and holy, and full of piety, ſo that we may conſtantly worſhip him, with a pure, intire, and uncorrupt mind and voice.</hi> And it is very wonderful (if any thing can be ſtrange, which we find comming from that monſtrous wit) that <hi>Socinus</hi> ſhould profeſs Chriſtianity, and yet deny that which common humanity taught others, as great wits as himſelf. For denying that Religion or Worſhip of God is natural to man, as in divers places he doth; what account can he give of many Heathen, who never heard of, or received any ſuch revelations, as he holds neceſſary to make God known in the world? And why? becauſe there are certain people in the <hi>Indies</hi> (ſaith he) which have no reverence of a Deity. But doth he think that nature teacheth us juſt ſo much as we actually know, and no more? It ſhould ſeem ſo indeed, by his reaſonings and concluſions. But that was his folly and miſtake; as much as it would be to hold an opinion, that the Preacher of the Goſpel doth not inſtruct or adviſe men in Religion, the knowledge and ſervice of God, becauſe they profit not by him; but live profanely and vitiouſly. For that we ſay is natural to us, and that we have by the Law and light of Nature, which we have ſo within us, as that by the help of them, we may arrive to the knowledge of the truth, not that, whether we will or no, we ſhall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily attain it. And ſurely it is but as the opening of the eyes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a drowfie perſon, to diſcern the light of the day, for a man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch notices as theſe, by vertue of that natural light in him, and thoſe legible Characters writ by Gods finger in the heart of man. He is franck enough to man, and more than enough, more then any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in magnifying mans natural reaſon, and natural freedom of will, and his power in chooſing good and refuſing evil, and living regularly without thoſe Divine aids, judged neceſſary by all good Chriſtians. But how can this be done without the acknowledgment of a Deity, and the worſhip of it? But it ſeems he muſt give place to <hi>Tully</hi> in Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">Cicero pro Plancio.</note> whoſe words are theſe, <hi>In my judgment Piety is the Foundation of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:</hi> which if true, as true it is, how can he hold that a man can have any one moral vertue, without devotion towards God? And can devotion to God be ſeparated from the knowledge of God? There are, it may be, ſome Nations which are ſo inhumane and barbarous, as to regard neither truth nor juſtice. Doth it therefore follow they have no ſuch ſeeds of both theſe ſown in their hearts, as are naturally apt, if not violently choaked, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to vertuous and laudable actions and habits? Many men, we ſee, lay violent hands on themſelves, and take away their own lives: ſhould any wiſe man then conclude from hence, Nature never taught him to preſerve it?</p>

                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:55232:201"/>It may further be argued for a naturalneſs in man to be Religious, and to agnize and worſhip a Deity, from the abſolute neceſſity of it to the ſubſiſtance of humane ſociety. Man is naturally ſociable, ſaith the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: but without Religion, no Civil ſociety can long or well hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and therefore, if Nature hath diſpoſed man to the one, and this cannot be attain'd without the other, it will follow that the neceſſary means muſt in ſome manner be provided to that end, by the author of that firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: unleſs we will grant that too (as commonly one abſurdity tumbles in upon the neck of another, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves) that nature deſigns things in vain.</p>
                  <p>Of this natural neceſſity of Religion, diverſe have treated; whom I might imitate but that I ſtudy compendiouſneſs and upon that reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance no more than in the Original of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy begun rudely and barbarouſly by <hi>Romulus;</hi> and ſo in all likelyhood to have ſuddenly vaniſhed and expired; had not <hi>Numa</hi> ſtay'd and ſecur'd it by Religion, and the fear of the Gods, as is obſerved by <hi>Florus: He brought a fierce peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely that Queſtion moved in the Schools, Whether Theology, or Religion be a ſpeculative or Practical vertue, is never like to be decided until the different Parties agree to compound the matter by taking in both, and making it both <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Practical,</hi> as we do. For undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it delivers rules and Articles of Faith, it is ſpeculative; as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers Rules and preceps of Holy and divine Life, it is Practical, and both theſe it doth; as we have ſhew'd. But it is the practical part of it or worſhip we are at preſent concerned in; and of which no ſmall doubt may be made, whether it conſiſts more in the Fear or Love of God? but I ſuppoſe it may be, as be before diſided. It being an Affection of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man conſiſting of Reverence and love of God, and demonſtrating the ſame in Acts proper and proportionable thereunto.

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the two parts of Divine Worſhip, Inward and Outward. The Proof of outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as due to God: and that it is both due, and acceptable to God.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BY what is expreſſed in our General deſcription of Worſhip, it may appear that there are two Principal Parts of it: The one conſiſting in inward affection; and the other in the outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The inward diſpoſition of the mind or ſoul of man is that on all hands is agreed upon as moſt juſtly due and proper to God alone in the ſupreameſt manner: God calleth for the heart ſo often in his holy word as his proper portion; and the Spirit as that which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nearer to the nature of God, as purely ſpiritual and incorporeal. For <hi>God</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth:</hi> Though if we ſhould take theſe words according to the prime intention, they would be found not to aim ſo much, if at all, at diverſe manners of worſhip under the ſame kind: but at ſeveral kinds ſuch as were the Judaical and Chriſtian: the meaning of Chriſt being this, that the hour or time was coming when there ſhould be no longer uſe of thoſe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:55232:202"/>
corporal ſervices and Sacrifices under the Law, but in lieu of them the ſpiritual and true worſhip of the Goſpel ſhould ſucceed. But no queſtion can be made of the excellency of that true ſpiritual inward devotion of the heart and mind to God, as the moſt abſolute, moſt required, moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: and in compariſon of that, all outward worſhip being no better without it than groſs Hypocriſie, rather incurrs the diſpleaſure of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God than pleaſes him. Therefore, leaving that which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are in their judgements ſufficiently ſatisfied in, and hold themſelves obliged unto; we ſhall take up the defence of the <hi>outward worſhip,</hi> in great manner oppoſed by too many.</p>
                  <p>And truly, They that argue ſo contemptuouſly and wildly, as the vulgar cuſtome doth, againſt outward worſhip of God; ſhall not need to go far to ſee their own folly. For to ſay, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and <hi>'Tis the heart that God calls for,</hi> and, <hi>'Tis the zeal of the Soul,</hi> and ſuch like looſe ſayings, what do they but cut the throat as much of vocal prayer, and Preaching, as of any thing elſe? For if God will accept the heart, and looks no farther than the purity and good diſpoſiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of the mind, Audible Prayer, and Preaching muſt together with the reſt be excluded, as impertinent in Gods ſervice. We know that the prayer of the heart (as in the Caſe of <hi>Hannah</hi>) is accepted of God at ſome times, and in ſome places, as the true Love and Charity to our Neighbour inclining us to do him good and relieve him when it lies not in our power: but St. <hi>James</hi> looks on them and cenſures them as meer uncharitable mockers, and not relievers of their neighbours, who ſhall only pretend they mean them well inwardly, and ſay unto them, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi>

                     <hi>in peace, be ye warmed, and filled: notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the body:</hi> Even ſo Faith, and ſo the will, and the heart, and the Spiritual worſhip without works are all dead, and are a meer mockery of the divine Majeſty; a corrupting and perverting of his holy word, and a bitter <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> turning it againſt himſelf: and as much as if it ſhould be ſaid, Seeing you will needs have the heart you ſhall have it: that is ſo, as to have nothing more. It were ſuperfluous and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to cite the many miſunderſtood and miſapplied texts of Scripture to delude the moſt ignorant, and, at the ſame time, moſt preſumptuous of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. None ſpeak more after the phraſe which hath deceived ſo many, than that not long ſince quoted, <hi>Wo be to you Phariſees, for ye tithe Mint and Rue, and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11 42.</note> 
                     <hi>all manner of Herbs, and paſs over Judgment and the Love of God.</hi> Doth not the Scripture here ſeem to condemn, and that under a curſe, ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le ſervices as are there expreſſed? It ſeems ſo indeed, and really doth, as much as any outward worſhip of God: But it doth but ſeem ſo. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, it was moſt agreeable to it, that ſuch minuter ſervices ſhould be perform'd, but that ſo performed as ſtudiouſly and ſuperſtitiouſly to neglect the other more weighty, was it which incenſed God againſt them.</p>
                  <p>And here comes in that general argument alſo, above touched. Faſt from ſin (ſay they) and for outward faſts it matters not: Wiſely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly ſaid, like able Divines indeed. And ſo, faſt or abſtain from ſin, and ye ſhall never need to pray, nor hear Sermons, nor to feed the Hungry, nor cloth the Naked; no, nor to believe in God: which is all ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have left them of Religion ſtarved into an unactiveneſs; Would it not make a mans Hair ſtand upright to ſee, and hear what precipices of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm and follies Men diſpute themſelves into? And ſo they may (as they ſuppoſe) enjoy their luſt of contradiction and contempt of others,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55232:203"/>
ſtrike through the loins of all Reaſon and Religion, at the ſame time: Reaſon, which they ſet, by ſuch ſophiſtry as this, to fight againſt it ſelf. For Serving of God in Spirit and in truth, and abſtinence from all ſins, as well of Omiſſion as Commiſſion, is the very perfection and end of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And if there were no more required but a ſimple command to do it, on Gods part, not directing us to the way: and no more on our part, but preſently and immediately to become holy and perfect, without the proper means conducing to ſuch high and not eaſie ends; then forſooth, theſe Diſputants were the beſt Councellors: but if there be outward means ordained in general by God, and applicable many times by humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to the effecting ſuch ends, and that outward acts of worſhip are of this nature; I only bluſh at the perverſeneſs and folly of theſe men and ſo leave them. Yet out of pitty towards ſome, who, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after <hi>Abſolome,</hi> are carried away from the truth in the innocency of their ſouls; I ſhall endeavour to ſtay them by adviſing them to conſider what <hi>Perkins</hi> wri eth well in theſe words; <hi>Indeed all the worſhip of God is Spiritual, even</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But were it not ſo, yet the worſhip of the Body it ſelf is a real, and in ſome degree, an acceptable ſervice unto God, even diſtinctly conſidered from that of the Mind; as the ſame Author alſo confeſſes, upon this ſolid ground: <hi>God is the Creatour not only of the ſoul of man, but alſo of the body, and we bleſs God not only with the heart, but alſo with the tongue. Therefore the whole man muſt pray in publick.</hi> And who is it that grants what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayes, <hi>All thy works praiſe thee, O Lord:</hi> and denies not the body<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 10</note> to be the workmanſhip of God, but muſt grant that the body is obliged to the worſhip of God, as really as the ſoul? Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Glorifie</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>God in your body, and in your ſpirit which are Gods?</hi> The Body and the Soul are both ſaid to be Gods: and therefore are both to be rendred unto God, according to their ability and capacity: And it is no leſs ridiculous for men to deny bodily ſervice to God, as unprofitable and unacceptable unto him, becauſe God calls ſo earneſtly for the ſpiritual and inward ſervice of the mind, than it would be to deny God the inward worſhip of the Soul joined to the Body; becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Worſhip him all ye Saints, and let the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> Whatſoever the idle and unprofitable ſervant ſaith in the Goſpel of God that <hi>he was an hard man reaping where he had not ſown, and gathering where he ſtrawed not,</hi> yet it is nothing ſo. For God<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 24.</note> doth not require more than he hath given; and therefore having given leſs to the Body than to the Soul, do we think he will accept of no leſs from the Body, than he doth from the ſoul? The Parable now touched proves the quite contrary: God there, well rewarding leſs encreaſe and return, though not in the Arithmetical proportion, yet Geometrical. Put the Caſe, that the body hath received but as five talents, and the ſoul ten; nay, that it hath received but one: yet the condemnation for not improving that one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cauſe and ground given, ſufficiently evidence, that the improvement according to that ground, would be an occaſion of praiſe and reward.</p>
                  <p>And this Thirdly appears from the <hi>peaceableneſs</hi> of man in bodily Acts. For if the mind being well diſpoſed to God, the Bodily outward acts are ſometimes ſinful as in the ſimulation of worſhipping an Idol with outward acts when inwardly a man deteſts and abhorrs the ſame; as certainly they are: then ſurely, though the mind be not ſo well devoted to God as it
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55232:203"/>
ought (provided it be not bent to the contrary) the outward acts may be acceptable in ſome degree to God. And therefore <hi>Origen</hi> hath theſe words. It is one thing to worſhip, and another to adore. A man may ſometimes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore<note place="margin">Origen Hom. 8. in Excd.</note> unwillingly as they that flatter Kings, when they perceive they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to that ſort of Idolatry, do ſeem to adore [or fall down to] Idols. Whereas in their hearts they are well aſſured that an Idol is nothing. But to worſhip is with entire affection and addiction to be ſubſervient. if then a Man may offend God with his body, why may he not pleaſe him? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will according to his due have all, or none? This makes as much againſt the ſimplicity and ſingularity of the Souls worſhip as the bodies, and no more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Scripture giving us precepts of outward worſhip, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of Gods rewarding bodily ceremonies of worſhip; doth abundantly commend the ſame unto us. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians, Providing for</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 21.</note>

                  <p>Fifthly, External worſhip and reverence are not only ſo many indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Effects of the more noble, and divine worſhip of the Soul, and fruits which are as acceptable as the tree that bears them: but which is much more, they are very often cauſes of the devotion of the mind, and great inflamers of the affections, as well of him that ſo demeans himſelf in humility and reverence, as of the beholder: Of this latter St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, in his epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where he treats of the external decency, and order, to be obſerved in the worſhip and Houſe of God; upon which he that cometh in falling down on his face (which is one of thoſe outward Acts we here mean) <hi>I will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 25. 2 Cor. 9. 12.</note> And in his Second Epiſtle he ſaith, <hi>Your zeal hath provoked very many,</hi> Which zeal was manifeſted in external works. And who may not obſerve, not
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55232:204"/>
only an <hi>Influence</hi> of the inward affections moving the outward parts: but a <hi>Refluence</hi> (as one may ſay) of ſuch outward acts upon the inward faculties, to the exciting them. And that ſpeaking cholericly doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a principle of Angrineſs, but augments the paſſion inward; and ſo in love and zeal, in matters as well divine, as prophane, acting humility and devotion outwardly, doth wonderfully excite thoſe graces in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add but one more argument to beget a better opinion of external and bodily ſervices in Gods worſhip, than vulgarly prevails: And that is, The general practice of the ancienteſt and beſt Chriſtians, I ſay, beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and pureſt and perfecteſt worſhip of God, in open defiance of them of late times, who inſolently magnifie themſelves and modern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, to the contempt of their much ſuperiours in piety and years. They had many outward rites and ceremonies adorning the worſhip of God; which I prefer infinitely before the ſowre and ſevere nakedneſs of Gods ſervice amongſt them. 'Tis not to be denied, that in proceſs of time, Ceremonies multiplied to the prejudice of Religion; but I think ſcarce at any ſo much, as the affected prophaneneſs hath on the other ſide, damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it. And they that argue from the great opinion ſome have of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to the total abolition of them, put an argument into the mouths of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to renounce communion with them that hate them, and deteſt them to that ſuperſtitious exceſs, as to have none at all: and by the ſame rule, to love them, becauſe they deteſt them who have been ſo ſcandalous in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</p>
                  <p>Now this external Worſhip we here plead for, is an Adoration of God: An humiliation of the Body by external Acts, and geſtures, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and reverent eſteem of the Divine Preſence; and the ſmall and low eſteem we have of our ſelves: which is ſo neceſſary and natural that it is to be admired how the contrary carriage could ever be received as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God or man; were it not that the Tempter to irreligion knoweth no ſhame: nor they who are abuſed by him, and his Inſtruments, no mean in flying Extreams. What is more frequent in Scripture than examples of ſuch as thus humbled themſelves before God? Falling down in Scripture (which neceſſarily is bodily Adoration) hath been alwayes ſuch an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable concomitant of Divine inward worſhip, ſuch an excellent part of it, that by a current Synecdoche it is put for the worſhip of God entirely and abſolutely. For what elſe may we underſtand by that Prophetical ſpeech of Chriſt. <hi>All Kings ſhall fall down before him, all nations ſhall worſhip.</hi> And ſo in the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Shall I fall down to the ſtock of a tree?</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 11. Eſay 44. 19.</note> And ſo in the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Shall I fall down to the ſtock of a tree?</hi> That is, worſhip it in this bodily manner. And ſo in the next Chapter: and the 46. Chapter. <hi>They fall down yea they worſhip:</hi> by which words the Prophet<note place="margin">Eſ. 45. 14. Eſ. 46. 6.</note> condemns the Idolatrous practiſe then in uſe. And, as hath been ſaid, if there were nothing good in ſuch outward adoration which might be pleaſing to God; it could not diſpleaſe him to have it given unto Idols, or falſe Gods; as every where in Scripture it doth. What a piece of matter had it been for the three Children of God to have fallen down before <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>'s<note place="margin">Dan. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> Image, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> if there were no account to be made of ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts? not ſo much ſurely as of diſobedience to the Kings command. Nay, what hurt would there be to fall down to the Devil (as Chriſt was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do by that Evil and ambitious Spirit) if it did not at all belong to<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 9.</note> God. Or what good do they, what glory do we underſtand given by the 24 Elders to God, in the Revelation, when they fall down before the throne<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 10.</note> of God, if ſo be there is nothing in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:55232:204"/>Surely therefore, it is a part of our duty and ſervice, thus to adore the Divine Majeſty, thus to humble our bodies in his preſence. And it is ſeen commonly, in Bowing or inclining any part of the body; and ſometimes of the whole, by caſting it upon the earth as unworthy to ſtand before God, and to beget the deeper ſenſe of our own vileneſs, and to move God to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our proſtrated body and dejected mind. Sometimes it may ſuffice to<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 33.</note> incline the head, as it were bluſhing to lift it up with any confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and heaven: Sometimes incurvation of the Body, ſometimes bending of the knee, and ſometimes conſtant and devout kneeling: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as occaſion and opportunity ſhall be offered, and the ſpring of inward devotion move the outward parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>For all this while we urge not ſo neceſſarily any, much leſs all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts, ſo as to require them ſimply to divine worſhip, as if a Man could not be accepted without them. Yet ſo far again we do, that where juſt autority, competent opportunity, and means, expect any of theſe from us, wilfully and contemptuouſly to neglect them, doth make me real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that God will not hear or accept the pretended real devotion of the inward man, as being corrupted with diſobedience and irreverence, and excluſive of part of his Right.</p>
                  <p>And an other rule for directing this manner of worſhip is this, that we are not ſingly and of our own head, in publick, to put in uſe, or act any ſuch ceremonious devotion to the offence of the more general cuſtom, and warranted practiſe of the Churches, of which we are Members. For all Acts of Reverence are to be eſtimated, not by private opinions, but by publick and general approbation. For ſeeing ſcarce any ceremony is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but all by inſtitution and reputation of men judged proper, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent: this Decency, the Cuſtom of places and Sentence of Superiours muſt determine, leſt the Church falls into that unhappy ſtate of which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> complains, and be ſubjected to more burdenſome and contrary Rites than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church ſuffered; while it is thought lawful under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which was not tolerated under the Law, for every ſingle man either to deviſe a form of worſhipping God, out of his own head, or to bring thoſe Rites into that Church in which he lives by his own will, which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be in uſe in others, whereof perhaps he hath read, or which in his Travels he hath ſeen, which the farther they have been and more ſtrange al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways paſs for the moſt commendable: a thing which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle condemns, and that worthily and gravely: and not all Rites intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ordinarily, and orderly into the Church by good Councels and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority: as many vainly have imagined and drawn his words with wonted ignorance, or ſpite, againſt the uſe of Ceremonies. But what we were ſaying is this: that all Reverence, and gravity, and decency are wholly ſuch by humane agreement and opinion; and that of the Region wherein they are uſed. For if any poſture, or geſture, or Habit were naturally good or Evil, decent or indecent, it would be ſo to all countries and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the contrary to which is moſt certain. <hi>viz.</hi> That what one people judgeth grave and decent, another eſteemeth ridiculous, and uncomely. To bare the Head in the Weſtern parts of the world, is a token and Act of Reverence, to whom it is done: but abſurd and grievous to the Eaſtern Parts. Again, in the Weſtern Parts, for Men to move their hats, and to bend the Knee to one, is Reverence; but for women to do ſo, is fooliſh and ungrateful to any. Black clothes and habit in the <hi>European</hi> Parts and amongſt Chriſtians are generally looked on as comely, grave, and decent
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55232:205"/>
for perſons of the ſobereſt rank, but odious to the <hi>Turks:</hi> and ſo might inſtances be given in many things of like nature. Which are not for any intrinſick worth in them or natural, received into the ſervice of God, but for that they are partly by conſent of men where we live, acknowledged for proper notes of Reverence, or elſe are by expreſs conſtitution decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſuch which are deſigned by the Church to ſignifie, and expreſs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and eſteem of what we do: and upon that become ſuch. For neither do words themſelves naturally ſignifie what we mean by them; nor do letters naturally give ſuch a ſound to a word compounded of them, but altogether by human agreement and appointment, no more do theſe ſigns and ceremonies of themſelves, but by conſent and inſtitution, imply reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion.</p>
                  <p>Where then do theſe frivolous and quarrelſome fellows appear, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to undo ſomething done before them, and do ſomewhat that better ſuits with their own humours, and unchriſtian tempers, deviſe monſtrous things in ſuch rites malitiouſly apply them, zealous enforce the contrary, upon ſuch abſurd errours: And will take no denial, when they are pleaſed to utter ſuch ſlanders, as theſe: <hi>That we urge them as of abſolute neceſſity, We prefer them before the more material ſervice of God: We make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Communion with us.</hi> The firſt and ſecond of which are directly falſe, and never can be made good: The Third is indirectly true. For by conſequence indeed they become conditions of Communion in all Churches; and their mouths are opened directly and expreſly, according to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, only againſt our Church, yet all are no leſs concerned than ours, yea their own Conventicles are in as much danger of this argument, as our Churches. For I appeal unto themſelves whether they would not thruſt out from among them ſuch as ſhould dare againſt their Orders, to do what they liſt amongſt them? Would they ſuffer one amongſt, that ſhould conſtantly take the Communion kneeling, while the reſt ſat, or ſtood? Would they not ſeverely cenſure and being obſtinate eject ſuch an one as ſhould bow at the name of Jeſus, againſt their will, and perhaps him that ſhould own he makes a conſcience of being covered in the houſe of God? Muſt they not here interpret themſelves better in their famous modern Maxime, <hi>Of making outward Rites conditions of Communion,</hi> and ſo, that their adverſaries ſhall come off as well as they? Or they ſuffer as much miſchief by their own weapon as any elſe. But what they will ſay, we regard not, no more than what they have ſaid in that Rule it ſelf, frivolous and fallacious. That which we ſay to it, is the quite contrary, That we do not make ſuch Orders or cuſtomes conditions of our communion, ſo much as they make them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of non-communion, and Separation. Let the matter then be brought fairly before all equal Judges, who are to be blamed, they, who have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority either to appoint, or put down any Ceremonie, and yet, upon that which they can never prove to be forbidden, or unlawful, but as it likes them not (by which they argue us out of all but their own inventions) refuſe communion with that Church, to which they have all general obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to joyn themſelves: Or they, who being over them in the Lord (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or not) do form outwardly by ſuch Ceremonies and Rites, the more intrinſick parts of Gods Worſhip requiring under the ſin of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and pain of Eccleſiaſtical cenſures following thereupon, ſubmiſſion unto them. In fine, We accuſe them (and believe we are much better able, as we are always ready to prove it) of making innocent (I do not ſay inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, for where ſhall we find that thing that offends not ſome body) rites
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55232:205"/>
and orders the only ground of Schiſm; rather than we make them condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Communion: And ſo what they will get by this juſtification of themſelves, they may, and hope will at length, put in their eyes, and cauſe tears of repentance to fall from them, for their many groundleſs prevarications, and ſlanders of both Powers, God had ſet over them.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the Second thing conſiderable in Divine Worſhip; <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtate wherein we ſerve God. What is a State. The formal cauſe of a State Divine, Vows. What is a Vow.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Second thing wherein religious worſhip doth conſiſt in general, is the ſpecial ſtate which a true Believer chooſeth to ſerve God in. The ſtate of any thing doth import in it,<note place="margin">Inde eſt quod etiam in actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus humanis dicitur negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um habere ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem ſtatum; Secundum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem propriae diſpoſitionis cum quadam immobilitate ſeu quiete. <hi>Thomas 2 dae. Qu. 183. c. 1.</hi>
                     </note> conſtancie and ſubtilty, as <hi>Thomas</hi> hath not amiſs deſcribed it in general, ſaying, <hi>In humane actions a matter is ſaid to have a ſtate, according to its particular conſtitution, with a certain immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and reſt.</hi> Whatever therefore is by nature uncertain and mutable, and becomes determined and fixed, may be ſaid to be in ſuch a ſtate, in which it is ſo fixed. And though, by the vanity and natural wantonneſs of Mans will, he is too often unreſolved and fickle in his due Obligations towards God; yet by Reaſon, and much more Religion, every man is bound to God, and his liberty is to ſerve God, in the common ſtate of Religion; which reſtrains his irregular motions, and confines him to the will of God. And under this due ſubjection is every man eſpecially brought, by being baptized, and therein vowing faith and Chriſtian o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto God. But as Religion in general is the ſtating and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a man towards God, and as Chriſtian Religion is yet an higher, ſtricter, and holyer obligation and ſtate than Religion in common, ſo yet, in Chriſtian Religion it ſelf, are there more large and free, and more ſtrait and determined wayes of ſerving God: which when they are not movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or mutable in themſelves, may be aptly called ſtates of Religion, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the general Profeſſion. We are therefore firſt to conſider the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:55232:206"/>
formal cauſe of this ſtating a mans ſelf in Religion, and then the principal matters wherein this ſtate doth conſiſt: which may be reduced to theſe three, <hi>Holy Orders, Celebacy or Singleneſs of Life, Monaſtick Life,</hi> with its appendages of Poverty and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>That which gives the formality to all theſe, and makes them a proper ſtate, is the bond of a Vow, under which a man binds himſelf duly to obſerve the ſame. And a Vow is a ſolemn and ſacred promiſe made to God by a Perſon free to that thing, of performing ſomewhat above his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obligation. For by the common covenant and obligation, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath upon him, as a Chriſtian, and baptized, he hath bound himſelf to obſerve all things directly commanded by God; and which are neceſſary to ſalvation. But becauſe theſe things neceſſary to ſalvation, are not ſo eaſily determinable by every man, but varying according to the talents of Grace and Nature; according to outward means, and according to opportunities put into the hands of Man by God, it hath been ever both prudently and piouſly practiſed by devout and faithful perſons, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the neceſſary duties, by taking upon them ſome things that are not of themſelves, or generally neceſſary to the pleaſing God, and ſaving themſelves. Theſe extraordinary Services are commonly known by <hi>Counſels Evangelical</hi> or <hi>Perfections,</hi> becauſe they tend to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and devout walking with God in Mortifications, Self-denyals of the pleaſures, and unneceſſary Comforts of this world, and more pure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and ſpiritual communion with God, in the exerciſe of acts of Religion.</p>
                  <p>There are many amongſt the eminent Reformers who oppoſe ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Counſels (it is to be feared) becauſe they would carry away the credit from others of being Religious, and cannot endure to have any thing more eminent in that Religion condemned by them, than is to be found in their Reformation; and therefore they ſay, there is no ſuch thing to be allowed or received as Evangelical; that is, in plain tearms, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Perfection: but all ſtates of Chriſtianity are alike. For ſurely had it not been ſelf-defenſe and ſelf-love, not to venture fleſh and bloud farther than is abſolutely neceſſary, but that they might enjoy the world in all its benefits and accommodations not inconſiſtent with future bliſs; they would never have dar'd to have contradicted the common voice of all Chriſtians, one or two perhaps excepted: who were manifeſtly reprehended by the general ſentence of the age wherein they lived; and not only Chriſtians, but Jews, and not only Jews, but Heathens too, pretending to Religion. And for my part, as I reverence that as a Law of Nature, in which all men generally conſpire and concur: ſo do I eſteem that as a Law of Religion, which all Religious People have, in ſome manner, uſed: But all People, as well Chriſtian as Unchriſtian, have ever allowed, as very laudable, the uſe of Vows in Chaſtity, and ſecludedneſs from the common courſe of the world. And this is of greater force to me than any arguments by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries brought to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>They want not indeed certain pretty colours to perſwade, rather than prove their modern ſingularities: Some of which, and the principal, are theſe. Firſt, that we are commanded to love and ſerve God with all our hearts, with all our ſouls, with all our ſtrength, and therefore there can be no place for ſuch perfection, ſeeing it is no more than we are bound to do.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That to love and ſerve God with all our might, is, in the general, a direct Precept; and not barely an advice or counſel given to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55232:206"/>
us. But the ſpecial duties wherein this univerſal and abſolute ſervice of God conſiſt, are not ſo determined. For we may love God with all our hearts, according to the intent of the Command, in any one ſtate of life, that is, ſo far as to prefer God and his ſervice before, and above all; and this may ſuffice to carry us to Heaven. But this <hi>All</hi> may be taken <hi>Intenſively</hi> or <hi>Extenſively: Extenſively</hi> when we ſubject all things really to our eſteem of God, not idolizing any worldly thing, or equalling it to him. But ſtill <hi>Intenſively,</hi> a man, ſo long as he continues in this world, may proceed to higher degrees of the Love of God. And theſe more perfect degrees are acquired by more conſtant attendance on Gods worſhip; and this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is cauſed by ſequeſtring our ſelves from thoſe many worldly cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances incident to us in this world: which though not abſolutely unlawful (for were it that Marriage or Monaſtick life were ſimply and generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, no queſtion but they would have been commanded or forbidden directly) yet upon common conſent, more hazardous than the ſeverer part of Chriſtian life may be. And neither wedded life, or a political life are of themſelves evil, but expoſe a man to more temptations, and leave him leſs at liberty to attend on the Lord without diſtraction. Yet all this will admit of exceptions, ſome men undoubtedly (whether Laical or Clerical) living much chaſter in wedlock, than others do in Celebacy, and ſingleneſs of life: and ſome men living more divinely and holily in the midſt of much buſineſs, and tumultuous Cities, than others in Cloyſters, or Deſarts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the worlds contagion and vanity. For might not this be, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts would certainly have been delivered in Scripture to bind us to one way. But no judgment or concluſion of a Caſe is wont to be made by wiſe men, from the variety and uncertainty of particular perſons, but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the thing it ſelf, whether ſuch ways of ſerving God, which are vulgarly called <hi>Evangelical Counſels,</hi> are not in themſelves, with the like concurrence of Gods Grace, and other due circumſtances which may be ſuppoſed common to other ſtates, more probable and apt means to attain heaven, and ſerve God more devoutly than the other: and whether this ſtate of ſeparation and dedication of our time and actions unto God, are not more ſuſceptible of the Grace of God than common converſations. The Affirmative we maintain, and ſee not how the foreſaid reaſon oppoſes it, to any purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond main reaſon is, That, though it is lawful, and may be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to chooſe ſuch a kind of life, yet it is not ſo fit to bind our ſelves to it by a Vow. For we muſt vow to do nothing which is not in our power to perform. But ſuch kind of Chaſtity, ſuck kind of Separation and Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of our ſelves from the World and civil Society, is not in our power to fulfil. And that becauſe they are the ſpecial Gifts of God; as the Scripture telleth us, when it ſaith, <hi>Every man hath his proper gift of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 7.</note> &amp;c. and theſe are ſuch.</p>
                  <p>But to this I demand, firſt, What they mean by a thing being in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Do they mean in our natural power, without Gods bleſſing and grace, above our natural ability? then indeed this, and many more Chriſtian duties are beyond our power and ſtrength to do of our ſelves. Our whole Vow of Baptiſm conſiſts of ſuch particulars as the Catechiſe tells us truly, <hi>We are not able to do of our ſelves.</hi> Shall the Vow therefore in Baptiſm be judged raſh, unreaſonable, and unlawful, becauſe we have vowed more than we can make good of our ſelves? Oh, but (ſay they) this Vow is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and commanded by God, but the other are unneceſſary and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55232:207"/>
But this is but little to the purpoſe, ſuppoſing all were true that is in the exception ſuppoſed: For we are now enquiring abſtractly, and in general, after the nature of a vow; whether a Vow may not be made of thoſe things that are not naturally in our power. For the neceſſity, or the command of God himſelf, cannot make that reaſonable for us to do, or vow to do, which we are wholly unable to do. And by conſequence, this ſort of vowing would be much worſe than the other, as bringing Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Juſtice into queſtion, as well as mans Wiſdom and Piety; that he ſhould command us to do that which we are not able to do, and to vow what we are not able to perform. But if they take Gods Grace, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and Goodneſs in to the aſſiſtance of mans natural or reaſonable abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as they ought to do, how can they ſay directly, that the matter of ſuch Vows are not in our power? St. <hi>Paul</hi> could do all things through him<note place="margin">Phil. 4 13. 1 Cor. 12. 31.</note> that ſtrengthened him. And ſo ſurely may other good Chriſtians do, ſo far as he requires. And we know the Scripture requires, <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts.</hi> The queſtion then will return again upon us with no leſs force than before; whether theſe ſtates be not more perfect, and better than others. For if ſo, they may be coveted and aſpired after; though they be not abſolutely in our Power. I confeſs, according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> all men have not the ſame gifts, either of Nature or Grace. <hi>Every man hath his proper gift of God,</hi> &amp;c. And withal, that ſuch may be<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 7.</note> the natural tempers and inclination of ſome perſons towards Conjugal and Political Society, that they may wholly diſtruſt themſelves in the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch Vows. And therefore ſuch Vows may be unlawful in thoſe circumſtances and junctures. But when a man conſiders, firſt, the Grace and Promiſe of God; when he conſiders again, the vertue of ordinary means to attain theſe graces, in withdrawing a mans ſelf from the outward Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to tranſgreſs, and denying himſelf the common occaſions diſpoſing to ſuch things, againſt which he vows; and laſtly, the efficacie of a Vow duly made; which upon reflexion may quench all ſparks falling into the heart or mind of man; he can ſcarce affirm poſitively, that ſuch a thing is not in his power, but becauſe it is not in his will.

For he finds another thing between <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> and that is, <hi>Monition</hi> or <hi>Admonition,</hi> which, ſays he, binds more than Counſels, and leſs than Precepts. And ſo I conceive it true, that in the Caſe above put of Gods grace more enabling a man, a diſpoſing him to greater perfections, then are common to Chriſtians, that there doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follow a tacite admonition, and particular injunction to improve the ſame to the beſt effects and ends: but this cannot properly be called a Precept, or a Command, according to the received manner of ſpeech, which to alter for no other reaſon but to gratifie ſquamiſh minds and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, is no reaſon. For a Precept according to <hi>Gerſon</hi> in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, is <hi>A Command obliging to obſervation of a thing, or act commanded:</hi> which deſcription I ſuppoſe he borrowed from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>A Precept is ſuch a thing that it is ſin not to obey it. A Counſel is that, which if you refuſe to make uſe of, you obtain leſs good, but commit no evil.</hi> So that as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Proſper,</hi> and innumerable other Fathers, as well Greek as Latin, ſpeak in this caſe, A Precept is that which keeps the Law. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that which tranſcends the Law. Now to apply this more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Commands and Counſels are general, and extend to all, but with this difference: that a Precept or Command is general and abſolute, binding all without exception under the penalties of ſin and puniſhment: Counſels bind all, but not abſolutely, but conditionally upon ſuch conſiderations of aiming at more then ordinary perfection of vertue and reward. Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be nothing elſe but a perſonal advice and exhortation, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuppoſals made of having (for inſtance greater meaſure of Grace from God:) But ſuch as this laſt cannot prejudice the two former, becauſe we are not now ſpeaking of Particulars, which are infinite, according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent occaſions, and ſo can be no rule to direct men by: but of thoſe things which may be reduced to general Rules, nothing perſonal is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in them. And thus the former Opinion holds good, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth two Claſſes of Chriſtians, from the two ſeveral methods and ways before them: And that though <hi>Martha</hi> may certainly attain heaven: Yet <hi>Mary</hi> may ſet above her there, and that by reaſon that ſhe had on earth choſen the better part.

                     <hi>yet they are not eſſentially requiſite to Chriſtian perfection. The firſt of theſe is clear from the diſcourſe of the Goſpel: For the ſecond, it is thus argued, Becauſe many have been perfect in a ſpiritual life without the obſervation of Evangelical Counſels, as appears from</hi> Abraham—<hi>and from</hi> Job. <hi>From whence it is manifeſt, that Evangelical Counſels ſo far pertain to perfection of Spiritual Life and conduce to it; becauſe they are as ſo many Inſtruments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly expediting and furthering perfection of Spiritual Life to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; and preſerves it being once had:</hi> Thus he: and no more, nor leſs do I mean or intend to ſay at preſent, concerning the uſe of them: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly underſtood and fairly conſidered, is ſufficient to plead for it ſelf. But could this be only ſaid for it, that no man hath dar'd directly to condemn it, it might ſuffice an equal mind. For though there were more than a good many that deny the Inſtitution of them in Scriptures, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55232:208"/>
deny the things ſo commended to be lawful, and conſonant to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion and the Scriptures: nor that thoſe methods duly obſerved, make not towards the high ends of Chriſtianity: only ſundry Caſes they are able to put, and I make no doubt, but might give many Inſtances of the not only vain, but evil ſucceſs of ſuch means. But ſo may they of many more things which they hold requiſite to edification, and increaſe of Grace. Was not <hi>Judas</hi> much worſe after the Euchariſt received (for that he did receive it, contrary to ſome mens opinion, I here ſuppoſe) than he was before? And we can inſtance in many who by zealous preaching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have expoſed themſelves and others to greater damnation, than if they had never taken on them that holy function, or theſe had not ſo devoutly throng'd them. Dr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> therefore againſt <hi>Campian</hi> ſpeaketh as much,<note place="margin">Humphredus contra 2 Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piani.</note> as I think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf demands in this, though he ſhowes an averſneſs to agreement therein, as ſuſpecting what is no wayes to be feared, as being a contradiction to the ſtate of the Queſtion it ſelf: which ſuppoſeth that thoſe perfections are rather voluntary than neceſſary; free, and not conſtrained; and the very tearms of the queſtion declare they are Counſels, and not Commands, and yet he pleaſes to write thus. <hi>They call them Evangelical Counſels, which are not commanded in the Goſpel. And what Chriſt ſpeaks of Eunuchs (for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake) in the Goſpel, and what Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks of Virginity, we oppoſe not greatly. Let it be a Counſel to whom it is given</hi> [but we have already ſhewed that Counſels no leſs than Precepts are given to all, though all do not, and none are bound to take them ſimply] <hi>ſo they conſent that it is not commanded; Let it be free, ſo it be not conſtrain'd. Let it be voluntary, ſo it be not neceſſary; not by a vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, not obtruded upon men.</hi> It were a manifeſt contradiction to hold that ſuch Counſels ſhould be ſo neceſſary or forced. None does, none can hold them ſo. There are not wanting indeed too many Inſtances of theſe ſtates impoſed upon perſons, without any conſent of theirs: and this is a notorious and unſufferable abuſe of them, not in a ſober mode de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the practiſers of it. In ſuch Caſes, until at leaſt there ſhall be a free conſent <hi>poſtnate</hi> to that ſtate, it can neither be called <hi>Counſel</hi> nor <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> but on the one hand extream and barbarous tyranny and villany; and on the other unprofitable miſery and compulſion.</p>
                  <p>But that which troubles many is the Vow annext to, and confirming ſuch like righteous reſolutions. For a Vow, ſay they, makes it neceſſary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys liberty. Indeed, if this liberty were taken away by any man, beſides ones ſelf, no ſmall invaſion of both natural and Chriſtian liberty, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſuch bonds: But when a man freely binds himſelf, he is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid than hurt in his precious jewel, Liberty. And is there not a Vow in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as well as in ſingle life? Should therefore a man refuſe to marry becauſe he thereby doth apparently take away his liberty? as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where he tells us <hi>A man</hi> [that is married] <hi>hath not power over his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>nor a woman power of her body.</hi> Indeed this he may do out of prudence hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, if he pleaſes. But if he pleaſes to marry, and not pleaſes to vow Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Conſtancie in marriage, he would be a profaner of that ſacred Order. If they ſay, that this is neceſſary, but the other is not neceſſary: and therefore this may be lawful and uſeful, but not the other; I anſwer, firſt, this begs the thing in queſtion, which is, that we are not to vow but in things in themſelves good or evil, which contradicts all examples of commendable vows in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, That it is equally neceſſary a man ſhould live in Chaſtity, whether in ſingle or wedded life; and it is certain, there is no invincible neceſſity of ſeeking remedy againſt the temptations of a ſingle
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55232:208"/>
life, by marriage. And it is certain likewiſe, that marriage doth not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly prevent the miſchiefs of incontinence of an higher nature. And ſeldom is it found but the ſame perſon, if he uſed the like care and conſcience over himſelf before his marriage, that he doth, and hath bound himſelf to do, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his marriage, but he might live continently out of marriage, as well as in marriage. For very many accidents do occur, and ſome conſtantly, in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which renders that remedy uſeleſs to men. Now, if it be argued that a man ought not to vow <hi>Virginal</hi> or <hi>Vidual</hi> Chaſtity, becauſe many times (which is true) the Devil takes an occaſion from thence to tempt him worſe; the ſame will be ſaid againſt the Vow of Fidelity to God and Man, in the ſtate of Matrimony. For the fall is much worſe, and the danger not much leſs, as hath been ſhewed. And the Devil moſt buſily and eagerly ſeeks to impel to thoſe ſins which are moſt notorious. How many have with little wit and great impudence, profeſſed they could love their own Wives above all women, were it not for the reaſon that God and Nature requires they ſhould prefer them ſo, that they are their wives, and that they are tyed to them, their liberty is deſtroyed thereby? And may not as good an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be made from hence againſt all Votal Ties in marriage, as from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? And whereas it is ſaid, a Vow caſts a man divers times into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temptation: it is meerly accidental and perſonal, according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular humour of ſome men, who knowing their diſeaſe of contradiction and renitencie to what is impoſed on them, may with prudence avoid ſuch a ſnare, as they call it. But we all know, things are not to be eſtimated or concluded from ſuch contingencies and perſonal irregularities, but from the nature of the things themſelves. And none can deny but the nature of a Vow is to bind, and not to looſe; and to prevent, and not to lead into temptations or ſnares: and withal, he that Vows the thing, or the effect, doth implicitly vow the means conducing thereunto, and againſt the occaſions and temptations tending to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>It is farther objected againſt a Vow, that it is taken to be part of the worſhip of God: And this, <hi>Being made part of the worſhip of God,</hi> is a general Battering Ram, whereby moſt ill Reforming Divines endeavour to beat down all things they like not. For firſt, they religiouſly hold that nothing muſt be part of Gods worſhip which he hath not commanded in his word: which is not altogether true, nor falſe, no more then the contrary; That every thing commanded in his Word is part of his worſhip. And again, they hold that every thing that is done in the worſhip of God, is part of the worſhip of God; and from hence ſet themſelves with great animoſity againſt all forms, and actions, and Ceremonies in order to the ſervice of God, as ſo many parts of the worſhip of God, of humane invention, and therefore to be utterly rejected: And ſuch, ſay they, are Vows.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Popiſh writers do grant, and go about to prove that they are Acts of Gods worſhip, but very unluckily to themſelves, holding that they are Counſels and not Precepts; The Puritan Writers, that they are ſo far from that, that they are unlawful, but in thoſe things that are commanded of God; and therefore, in the Inſtances before given of ſingle and ſeparate life, unlawful. But <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (it ſhould ſeem) goes by himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the uſe of all Vows under the New Teſtament, but approving of them under the Old, as commanded many times, and being uncommanded worſhip under the New Teſtament: And that with men of ſuch principles, is bad enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:55232:209"/>But I ſuppoſe a mean way is beſt in this caſe; which holdeth Vows law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even in uncommanded worſhip: and Secondly, that of themſelves they are no part, nor ſo much as act of Gods ſervice, but the manner on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his ſervice. And Thirdly, that it is no leſs lawful and expedient to Vow under the ſtate of the Goſpel than under the Law.</p>
                  <p>And to begin with the laſt; That which deceived <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, ſeems to be an erroneous ſuppoſition made by them, that Vows were under precept and command under the Law, in certain caſes; but it is not ſo. For though many Rules and Precepts are found in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law about governing and regulating them that had freely made Vows, there is no precept given that men ſhould vow, but that was left free. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe Precepts of paying Vows found in Scriptures, do not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the taking of Vows ſimply. So <hi>David: Vow and pay unto the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 76. 11.</note> meaneth no more than <hi>Vowing, pay unto the Lord:</hi> which is the meaning of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo, ſaying: <hi>The Egyptians ſhall vow a vow unto the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſaiah 19. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and perform it.</hi> And in no place of Scripture is there any injunction ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to vow. And therefore the caſe being alike as to the Vow it ſelf, though different as to the matter, if it were lawful for the Jews to do this uncommanded act, as they call it, it is alſo lawful for Chriſtians, whom they acknowledge to be no more, but rather leſs bound up from uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded worſhip than the Jews.</p>
                  <p>And from hence are eaſily and better anſwered <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> arguments againſt Vows of Chriſtians, then by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For we deny that Vows were inſtituted Ceremonies under the Law, which <hi>Martyr</hi> ſuppoſeth; for they were not inſtituted at all. And that he ſaith, <hi>That we have no mention of Vows in the New Teſtament as there is in the Old,</hi> is not altogether true, as ſhall be ſeen afterward: but if it were true; as hath been ſaid, thoſe things which we know by the light and law of nature, the Scriptures are not ſo ſolicitous ſimply to inſtitute, as to preſcribe Rules concerning the due execution of them. But common reaſon hath inſtructed Gentile, Jew, and Chriſtian, upon occaſion, to vow to God; and therefore, whatever is peculiar to Chriſtians is provided for by the New Teſtament, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the matter conſiſtent with Chriſtian Faith and common equity, and the manner, Firſt, that it be made by a Perſon who hath power over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For no man can make a lawful Vow to do any thing to the prejudice of the right of another. And therefore children under the power of their Parents, cannot bind themſelves firmly in any ſuch Vow which tendeth to the diſobliging them from their known duty to their Parents: neither can Subjects vow any thing to the diſſervice of their Soveraign or Country: Nor can Clergy-men vow any thing contrary to the ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Superiours, or detriment of the Church in general, unleſs it be ratified by them: but all is void, or may be made void by them in lawful power over them. And the Arguments of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> taken from Chriſtian Liberty have been anſwered already.</p>
                  <p>Now to return to the firſt, That Vows are lawful to Chriſtians is ſhewed already from the natural reaſon of Vows. And that it was not an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or introduced by God, firſt under him, appears from the general conſent of all religious perſons who never knew any thing of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or if, as in later times, ſome nations did, yet regarded it not: And from the practiſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> long before <hi>Moſes,</hi> who we read <hi>vowed unto the Lord a vow.</hi> It appears likewiſe from the many moral precepts in<note place="margin">Geneſ. 28. 20.</note> the <hi>Pſalms, Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> which concern themſelves very little in
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55232:209"/>
the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And the Predictions in the Prophets of Vows to be made at the time of the Goſpel, are not well put off by ſaying the Prophets ſpake figuratively. But it may be here noted, as a wonderful dangerous abuſe of the Old Teſtaments Autority, not to be content to admit an invalidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of proofs drawn from thence to confirm Evangelical Duties; but to make it no ſmall preſumption againſt the Evangelicalneſs of any duty, that it is firſt found in the Old Teſtament; which is a groſs abuſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; eſpecially by them who would be held enemies to <hi>Antimonians.</hi> They ought therefore, firſt of all, to ſhow that ſuch things are purely Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, that is, as the Law it ſelf is Moſaical, and Typical, and Ceremonial, before they can damn them there, for no better reaſon but, there they find them.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, when we challenge them to the moſt ancient and manifold Preſedents of the Chriſtian Church, who conſtantly made Vows of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous natures to God, they preſently betake themſelves to their common ſubterfuge, pretence of appeal to the Word of God as a Rule, and that without any reſpect to any not truly divine, Guides otherwiſe directing: And this they do, as confidently, as if it had been concluded out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the contrary. For in ſuch caſes indeed their appeal would be moſt juſt and reaſonable: but until that, little better then ridiculous; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially Scripture being before adviſed about, and appearing not defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the caſe; Antiquity and Holy precedents conſulted with, the better to know the mind of Scripture. For inſtance, that text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith of young Widows, <hi>They have damnation in themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>they have caſt off their firſt Faith.</hi> Many of late dayes interpret the Apoſtle to mean only the Faith of Chriſt, in general: Others underſtand him to ſpeak of a Faith particularly made to Chriſt, by the Order of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows vowing ſingleneſs of life; and in all reaſon this ſeems to be moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the context. But beſides this, appeal is made by the one party to the judgment of the ancient and holy Chriſtians interpreting this both by their writings and practiſe, as relating ſpecially to the dedication of Widowhood to God. After this fair dealing, for men to declare they will be tryed by none but that which they know is the main thing in queſtion, is very vain, and ſomewhat more. They having no ſpecial text ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting ſuch Vows, as this is to commend them. But the worſt of it is this, that if there were any way more perfect then that they have pitched on, they ſhould be ſufferers in the good opinion of the world, but that muſt by no means be endured. And this, at the end of all, is the great abſurdity they bring us to: but ſurely not ſo great, but both the Cauſe and Defenders of it may well ſhow their face after all this granted and owned.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing, now in the third place to be touched, is concerning the Nature of a Vow in it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo it is no proper act, nor any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of Gods Service, but the manner of it. For to vow to God is an indifferent thing to Good or Evil. A man may as well vow to Gods diſhonour, as his glory: It is therefore good or evil in relation to the matter, about which the Vow is made. For to vow Sacrifices under the Law, and to vow Alms under the Goſpel, or Virginity, or ſuch like, is no farther part of the Service of God then the thing it ſelf tends to the worſhip of God: and its nature and office is to bind to the true and due performance of a thing, but not abſolutely a duty in its ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The principle doubt on the contrary may be that which is taken from that which a man devotes to God, as an ingredient to all vows. For when a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55232:210"/>
man vows, he of a free man makes himſelf ſervile, and limited to one of thoſe things, to which formerly he was free. And this we have ſhewed is an argument of ſome againſt vowing; becauſe it takes away the liberty God had given. On the other ſide, the contrary party may in my judgment, turn it againſt them, and make it an argument of worth and excellencie, becauſe it gives to God that which is to us moſt precious. For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you may be free, uſe it rather,</hi> and <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty where with Chriſt hath made you free;</hi> he undoubtedly means only in reference to man; and then only, when we really have, and not preſume only that we have, ſuch a liberty: and when this liberty is that which pertaineth to the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, as moſt of thoſe places alledged to found a liberty, do aim at. But do they think (as it ſhould ſeem) that either Natural, Civil, or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Liberty is ſuch a thing, and ſo given unto us of God, that we may not render it to him, nor part with it again to him? Is it too good or ſacred to give him it, from whom we received it? Nay, the more dear and precious it is to us, the more acceptable it ſhould be to him. When we deny our ſelves the liberty he hath given us, the better to ſerve him: ſurely it is no leſs pleaſing to God than to part with meat, drink, money, and the time which he hath given us, dedicating the ſame to him. It is ſtrange therefore, next to monſtrous, that Chriſtians ſhould ſtumble ſo at the Scriptures (and they eſpecially, who will ſcarce allow any man to be cunning in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beſides themſelves, or to be governed by them as they pretend to be) as to make ſuch fond concluſions from them, the contrary to which is much the truer. To give away our liberty to God, is an excellent Sacrifice to him; and they would prove out of Scripture, we ought not to give it him at all.

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the Matter of Vows in particular. And firſt, of the Virginal ſtate, that it is both poſſible and laudable. And that it is lawful to vow Celibacie or Widowhood. No Preſidents in the Old Teſtament favouring Virginity. The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> vowed not Virginity, no Votary before the Annunciation.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>VVE now come to ſpeak more particularly of Vows, as to their matter. And becauſe the matter of Vows may be infinite, as good and evil, to which they extend themſelves; to Good affirmatively, and Evil negatively; I ſhall confine my Diſcourſe at preſent to the three moſt noted things in Vows, in which, we have ſaid, the ſtates of ſerving God principally conſiſteth: A Clerical ſtate, a ſtate Virginal or Vidual, and a ſtate Monaſtical: all which ordinarily do, or may relate to the worſhip of God in a more eminent manner; yet not with ſuch inſeparable vertues to that end, that it may not, and doth not often happen that they expoſe to greater miſchiefs. But it muſt alwayes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that we, nor any man elſe, do not compare the vices of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life with the vertues of a married life; nor compare the vices of a ſeparate and clauſtral life, with the ſobriety of a political life. For who is ſo fond and blind a Patron of them, as to commend them, before theſe? And yet we find moſt of the Adverſaries of the ſaid ſtates to argue from this moſt unequal ſuppoſition, that the one lives contrary to his Rule and Order; and the other agreably to his: and then having thus diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly ſtated the Caſe, triumph in a vain and ſilly victory, they preſume to have obtained. But put the Caſe, as in all juſtice and reaſon it ought to be, between a perſon that keeps to the rules and ends of ſeparate and ſingle life; and him that keeps to the rules and ends of a conjugal life, or political, and then let the matter be fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and determined; which is to be preferred before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Now that ſuch a ſuppoſition may be made, and that a ſeparate ſtate from women, and on the other ſide of women from men, may be laudably made good (which too many are ſo hard of belief as to judge next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) will appear from theſe three heads: From the Scripture: From Examples: And from the favourable ſenſe to be made of ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our Saviour ſuppoſes it done, and implicitly recommends the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to others, which he would never have done, had there been no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poſſibility of obſerving the ſame: For ſaying in St. <hi>Matthew, There be</hi>

                     <hi>Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it:</hi> Is there any Expoſitour of account in the Church, who can deny that Chriſt ſpake here of marriage? Can they deny that Chriſt gives his approbation of that <hi>Eunuchiſm</hi> voluntary, or denyal to a mans ſelf, the ordinary uſe of women? Can they deny that he adviſes to it upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that a man is able? How then can they deny the moral poſſibility of Virginal Chaſtity? And doth not St. <hi>Paul,</hi> wiſhing that <hi>All men were as he</hi>

                     <hi>was,</hi> wiſh that they lived in ſingle eſtate at leaſt, if not Virginity? And doth he not in the forecited place to <hi>Timothy,</hi> condemn thoſe perſons who have<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> violated their troth given to Chriſt, to live ſequeſter'd from men? I know late Interpreters have drawn the Apoſtles words to another ſenſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the received; and therefore eaſily not received by any man. Theſe and many other places of Scripture, eſpecially in the Seventh Chapter of the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which do prefer and exhort to ſingle life, do much more adviſe us of the poſſibility of duly perſevering in that ſtate, and at the ſame time, of the Eligibleneſs of that ſtate above the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The examples of the pure and holy life of unwedded perſons, are innumerable, and ſo glorious, as it puts me to the bluſh for them, who cannot bluſh, to oppoſe ſuch a cloud of witneſſes of Fathers, and Councils, and Canons Special concerning the tuition and value of ſuch Livers, rather than Injunctions to that ſtate, and eminent lights of Examples as all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtories abound with. They are confeſſedly many, great, and certain, and therefore I ſhall ſpare the labour of inſtancing in any of them: as likewiſe of the many and rich ornaments of Rhetorick wherewith the ancient Fathers have decked and commended that ſtate; even to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that they may be thought ſometimes to have overdone in the point: And do often put in ſeaſonable and ſerious Cautions that the eminence of<note place="margin">Aug de Sanct.

St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> commends the ſtate of Religion under the Goſpel from this, that under the Law Virginity is not ſo much as mentioned, any farther then by way of Propheſie, as to be in the New Law of Chriſt: and that particularly in <hi>Pſalm 45. v.</hi> 14, 15. And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Homily he gives us the reaſon, why Virginity was not commanded in the New Teſtament; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of its Excellencie, which all good Chriſtians could not attain to.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps (which is a third thing to be noted in devoting ſingle life to God) the ſeverities and fears are too much aggravated by ſome) and the difficulties of preſerving the ſoul and mind chaſt and pure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in true Virginity conſiſteth, rather than in corporal Integrity, as the Fathers, and particularly St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> grants, and proves at large. For
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55232:211"/>
when Chaſtity is vowed, certainly all evil motions and inward luſtings,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civ. Dei, lib. 1. cap. 17, &amp; 18.</note> are declared againſt, as well as outward impurities; but alwayes with a ſuppoſal of humane frailties, and allowances for ſuddain, unadviſed, and unapproved evil cogitations. Nay perhaps, though a perſon fails ſo far as to entertain with aſſent and conſent moroſe thoughts (as they call laſting and delighting cogitations of ſin) he may not be ſaid to break the form of his Vow, though he in ſome meaſure violates the end of his Vow. And as to ſin, which is contained in the Vow of Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, mens hands and minds were tyed from that, before they vowed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, though not ſo ſtrongly as afterward. The preciſe object therefore of ſuch Vows is properly an unwedded life, together with Chaſtity. Which, that it is not ſo unſuperable a difficulty as to exceed the ordinary power of man, by the Grace of God enabling him, appears from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of life of the oppoſers of that ſtate. For do not they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paſs through the difficult and fiery tryals of ſuch temptations fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the prime of their dayes, the ſtrength of corrupt nature, and weakneſs of reaſon, faith, and prudence to bridle irregular inclinations, and yet would take it very ill men ſhould condemn them for violaters of Gods Laws, and impure offenders in that kind? Can civil prudence or policie ſecure them in the moſt dangerous time of all, till they are freed from that place which makes them uncapable of being married; or they are put into a fair and hopeful condition to live handſomly in the world, according to their judgment and deſign; and may not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and nobler ends of Religion propounded to a mans ſelf, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly improved, have the ſame effect, and give them the ſame or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſafety? Do they, many of them, live chaſtly for thirty years, it may be more or leſs, unmarried, and yet would be loath to be cenſured for unchaſt perſons, and that upon the grounds of humane and carnal prudence, and dare they to decree them to naughtineſs out of neceſſity, who ſhall chooſe that life perpetually out of the grounds of Religion? This hangs very ill together: They will ſay out of St. <hi>Paul, It is better to marry than to burn.</hi> Very good. But when? and how? and on whom doth this Rule take place? ſo ſoon as he begins to burn? Or though he burns, not till he be rich enough, and is outwardly accommodated to his likeing? Can a man preſerve himſelf for the worlds ſake, when he may leſs expect the aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, and can he not for Gods ſake, when he may more hope for it?

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the ſecond ſtate of ſpecial ſerving God, the Clerical state or Miniſterial. Of the neceſſity and liberty of ſingleneſs of life in a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the next place, we are to look into the ſtate of ſerving God in Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtration: and here firſt apply what is above ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning Celebacie to the Clergy. There are not wanting amongſt the Romaniſts who annex Celebacie to a Clerical Life, by a Divine Precept; but with ſo little probability of truth, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of writing that, the learnedeſt of their own Party are aſhamed of them, and confute them: and ſo we leave them.</p>
                  <p>The moſt current opinion is, That by perpetual Tradition and Precept of the Church, marriage of the Clergy hath been reſtrained. But this will by no means hold, Firſt againſt the very firſt inſtitution of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Perſons by Chriſt himſelf; who, as it were to ſanctifie marriage in general, concerned himſelf in the marriage of others: And to declare how that ſtate was not at all inconſiſtent with a ſtate Clerical of twelve Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note place="margin">John 2. 1, 2.</note> which Chriſt choſe to miniſter for him, Eleven are ſuppoſed to be married perſons; or at leaſt to have been married formerly. To anſwer which by ſaying, that after they were choſen they forſook their wives, is to evade and not really to anſwer. Firſt, becauſe it had been as eaſie for Chriſt ſurely, to have picked out a dozen perſons free from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of women, as to make choice of ſuch as were wedded, had he judged any incapacity in theſe to the Evangelical Miniſtery. But ſecondly, do we find any thing in ſpecial preſcribed by Chriſt for ſuch ſeparation from wives, more than for other Chriſtians, who were not Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. For of all faithful Chriſtians it is ſpoken, in certain junctures, that whoever forſaketh not Father, and Mother, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Wiſe, and Children for Chriſts ſake, cannot be his Diſciple. And there is no rule but common neceſſity and prudence (not Divine preſcription) which requires any man for the Goſpels ſake to forſake his Wife, rather than his Father and Mother. Yet that the Apoſtles did actually abſent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſeparate themſelves from their Wives, and that others who enter'd
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55232:213"/>
into the miniſtration to the Church under the Apoſtles, foreſeeing what St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>the preſent diſtreſs</hi> of the Church, as well in regard of the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 26.</note> perſecutions of the Church, as the paucity of Preachers, the greatneſs of the Harveſt, and the ſmall number of Labourers, did decline the ſtate of marriage, is very probable: becauſe they were required by Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to <hi>Go and teach all Nations:</hi> which travelling life ill could conſiſt with cohabitation with Wives. And therefore, it muſt be given them <hi>Gratis,</hi> and not by the merits of any reaſon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> grounds they can ſhow, that that ſuch relinquiſhing of their Wives was either total, or upon conſcience made of the thing it ſelf. Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay expreſly in the words before thoſe now touched, <hi>Concerning Virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord?</hi> If ſuch as ſerved at the Altar were to be excepted, ſurely he<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 25.</note> would not have left the Rule ſo general as we find; ſpeaking only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humane prudence. And though they ſearch with their beſt eyes, they ſhall not be able to find in any other writings of the Apoſtles, one Text o Scripture obliging Biſhops or Prieſts to ſingleneſs of life, more than thoſe of the Laity: unleſs they argue from reaſon, That Virginal Chaſtity is more ſevere, more pure, more ſpiritual than conjugal, which is yielded, and therefore more obliging the Clergy, who ſhould be more ſpiritual perſons then others: all which I deny not; but ſay, that this binds them no more from marriage than it doth from wine and ſtrong drink, which if none of the Clergy ever uſed, they were the more to be commended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in ſuch caſes as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes <hi>Timothy, For their ſtomachs ſake, and often infirmities.</hi> And thus is <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s firſt proof laid.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Clericis, l. 1. c. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſole grounds then of unmarried ſtate of Prieſts muſt be fetch'd from Tradition and Reaſon: of both which we ſhall preſume to ſpeak a word or two. Apoſtolical Tradition is pretended, but not truſting much to that, recourſe is had to the Old Teſtament, from certain allegorical interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made of ſome Rites in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which may do well in the Church, where they uſed them to perſwade, but ill in the Schools, to prove the ſame as a neceſſary duty. The argument taken from the cuſtom of the Prieſt abſtaining from their Wives during the time of their miniſtration, I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">1 Chron. 24.</note> believe to have had an influence upon Primitive Chriſtians Judaizing in many other things of like nature, to reſtrain them from the uſe of their Wives upon ſolemn miniſtrations. But this was without Law or Canon, freely undertaken, and embraced as was Celebacie it ſelf, at firſt, until about the year 385. <hi>Siricius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> made a conſtitution that it ſhould, and ought to be; and that on that ground. And that the inferiour Orders, ſuch as Oſtiaries, Readers, Exorciſts, and Acolythites ſhould only be permitted to marry. But <hi>Alexander</hi> the third about the year 1160 proceeded, according to the method of that Church, to ſhut <hi>them</hi> alſo out the doors of Orders, that ſhould preſume to marry. But all, that was done againſt thoſe in greater or ſacred Orders in the Church for more than three hundred years after Chriſt, was to deny ſuch as were married acceſs to the Altar by way of miniſtration, who from that time abſtained not from their Wives, as did the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> and ſome in <hi>Spain.</hi> Only a cuſtom prevailed very generally and anciently, to ſuffer none who were in thoſe called <hi>Sacred Orders,</hi> ſuch as were Biſhops, and Prieſts, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to marry after they were ſo ordained; for if they did, they were diſmiſſed of their Office or their Wives. The Eaſtern Church ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of married perſons into the Clergy, and at length, underſtanding the Apoſtle, <hi>Let the Biſhops be the husbands of one wife,</hi> as a Precept rather
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55232:213"/>
than a Caution, that they ſhould be husbands of no more then one, which in all likelyhood the trueſt ſenſe; in the Sixth Council <hi>In Trullo,</hi> decreed they only ſhould be received into Prieſtly Orders, who were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. And therefore all antiquity for twelve hundred years together fails them in this, that it was otherwiſe then voluntary, that married Prieſts lived from their Wives who had before orders: or that married Men might not be made Prieſts: though 'tis confeſſed they preferred unmarried Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before them, until that Sixth Council, which for that reaſon amongſt others, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls a Profane Synod, and <hi>Baronius</hi> impious: ſuch a great veneration have they for the Autority of the Church, when it ſpeaks not their ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet as we are far from giving an exact and full account of this long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie here; ſo are we (ſo far as I can Divine at the judgment of our Church) willing to accommodate the matter with others, that can digeſt any thing but their own ſtout deviſes, to acknowledge a Power in the Church to bind, or looſe her ſons of the Clergy, to an unmarried ſtate, or to leave them free. For to aggravate matters to that height as to make it abſolute tyranny or Antichriſtian, and to be againſt the word of God, which ſaith <hi>Marriage is honourable in all things,</hi> and the like, implyes more of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Arguer, than ſtrength in the Argument; more of ſpite and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than ingenuity or ſoberneſs. For 'tis anſwered very ſufficiently, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is not condemned, but virginity commended before it. Marriage is not at all declared to be evil, when Celebacie is ſaid to be much better. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is not condemned, when certain perſons are condemned for marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Doth a Father that ſhould caſt off his Son for marrying without his liking and approbation, fall into the guilt of thoſe Hereticks, againſt which the Scripture and Antiquity both make, who ſimply condemn Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in it ſelf as unclean, and evil? No more ſurely doth that Church which prohibits it conditionally to her children. We hear of many hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands dying who leave their wives ſuch an additional Eſtate as they could not by any Law challenge, <hi>ſo long as they continue unmarried,</hi> or upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of continuing in the ſtate of widowhood. And ſo may a Father gratifie and oblige his children if he pleaſes, without incurring the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of holding marriages unlawful, whatever other cenſure may paſs upon them. And when the Church ſaith, ſhe will not admit any to miniſter in her Family, more immediately before God; what doth ſhe ſay more, than that Maſter of a Family, who will not have a married ſervant in his houſe about him, but likes it very well to uſe his ſervice in other matters. And does this deſerve ſuch noiſe and out-cryes as are made againſt it? Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is as free for the Church to judge of perſons fit and unfit for her uſe, as for any Lord or Maſter whatever: And to make a Law, not abſolute that ſuch a thing ſhould not be done; but that none that do ſuch things ſhould beimplyed in ſuch offices. And what reaſon is there that Civil Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhall directly deny this, but Eccleſiaſtical prudence may not? Are there not many other Societies, as well as Eccleſiaſtical, which without reproach do the very ſame thing? Men have a Freedom to do the thing, or not to do it, and more the Scripture hath not left us; but to do it without obſerving any condition from Superiour, neither the Law of God or Man hath left free. Can there be therefore any more moderate or equal courſe than ſo to leave the matter, that the one, ſingleneſs of life, ſhall be commended above the other, and peradventure countenanced and encouraged; but the other, accepted too? Yet neither extream will be content with this. But
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55232:214"/>
one will have a Law to abſtract, and the other, as it ſhould ſeem by their reaſons out of Scripture, have it enjoyn'd, though they put a ſtop to the concluſion, and will not have it contain what, if their Premiſſes be good, it muſt. For if every Biſhop muſt be the husband of one wife, and every Prieſt be a Biſhop, ſurely every Prieſt muſt marry. And if innocencie and purity can be no otherwiſe maintained, ſurely the Scripture requiring theſe, requires that too.</p>
                  <p>But now we come to the conveniencies and incommodities of the ſtate Virginal and Vidual, in reference to the Clergy. For now, waving the ſuppoſition of any Divine injunction, ſeveral Divine and Political reaſons have been invented ſufficient to determine againſt Prieſts, ſome of which being ridiculous, ſome profane, and ſome heretical, we ſhall mention only ſuch as have ſomewhat of ſobriety. The firſt whereof may be, That it becometh ſuch as attend on ſo ſacred a thing as Gods Altar, to be pure of body and mind too: And theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We know how that <hi>Fleſh,</hi> in Gods word, goes under ſuſpicion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of ſomewhat impure and contrary to ſpiritualneſs and true purity: and ſo, indeed, all fleſhlineſs muſt be avoided: But in it ſelf, it implies no more than a ſtate of imperfection not inconſiſtent with, though much inferiour to ſpiritual acts. In the firſt ſenſe, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Pride, and ſuch like are Fleſhly luſts, no leſs than Venery. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Conjugal acts and ſtate are in the ſenſe of the Goſpel no more Fleſhly, than eating and drinking. But whereas, we find many to have been willing to be miſtaken in ſo colourable a piece of Religion, as to declare even againſt the natural pollutions (as they may be called) as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial in themſelves to ſpiritual perfection, whether the will concurs thereunto or not, and though proper circumſtances be duly obſerved, I cannot excuſe them from Munichaean errour wholly; or at leaſt Judaical.

He ſheweth firſt, that no ſuch Heretick as condemns Marriage abſolutely ſhall be rewarded for their pretended purity: He proveth next, They ſhall be damn'd rather for it: while the Catholicks ſhall be promoted to the Societies of Angels, become bright Lamps in Heaven, and which is above all, abide with the Bride. He ſhoweth they are worſe than the Heathen Greeks, who ſo judge of Virginity and Marriage. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to Hell, but yet with this advantage, that they enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Marriage, Riches, and other worldly comforts for a time.

                     <hi>the choice of them that uſe them, they may be either. Nay,</hi> ſays he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>the ſobriety of Hereticks is much worſe then the riotouſneſs of any Heathens. For this only oppoſes Man, but that fights againſt God.</hi> And afterward; <hi>Hereticks profeſſing Chaſtity, not only pollute their ſouls but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo.</hi> And again: <hi>He that condemneth marriage injureth Virginity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> And much more to this purpoſe. Now if after all this, he abounds in the extolling of Virginity above Marriage, making it an Angelical life, at which Puritans are wont to mock and ſcoff: (which have ſtood them in more ſtead then Scripture it ſelf, to make way for their opinions) with what pretenſe of antiquity can the Levellers, of all orders and ſtates of Chriſtianity, object againſt Virginal or Vidual Chaſtity, either as not poſſible, or not lawful, or not more commendable than a wedded ſtate. And with what hazard of incurring the cenſure upon ancient Hereticks, do modern Patrons of Chaſtity raiſe their building upon their rotten foundations, as too many, who are aſhamed of it, do, notwithſtanding. Surely this may ſuffice equal minds, to grant: That as there is a prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emimence in the ſtate of Virginity, upon true Chriſtian and ſober princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, above that of marriage, upon Chriſtian principles likewiſe; ſo the ſtate of the Clergy being deſigned for more high and ſpiritual acts and ends than others, may be more fit and proper ſubjects of ſuch Evangelical ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon to induce them (for it cannot bind them) to it, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken from Covetouſneſs, which they ſay, generally attends the marriage of the Clergy. But doth it more conſtantly follow upon Prieſts marriage, than Lay-mens? this would be well known. But Clergy-men muſt do good with that they have, above other men. It is very true, in all moral and Chriſtian vertues, they ought to exceed others. But we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, what evil is in Prieſts marriage, not what good may be ſuppoſed to be done out of that ſtate: And we ſhould farther inform our ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do more good in the ſtate of Matrimony than others, not Prieſts; may not competently anſwer mens reaſonable expectations from them. Thirdly, it would be conſidered, whether ſingleneſs of life be ſuch a general cure againſt Covetouſneſs, as is taken for granted, and whether rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vice doth not incline a man to it, than outward occaſions. I know thoſe who have challenged the magnifiers of Clergy-mens ſingle life, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch, to give ſo many inſtances of married Prieſts that were covetous, as they could of unmarried. And in truth there appears to me little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the ſtudiouſneſs of Prieſts (or Lay-men) for their Nephews or near Kindred, and for their own Children: yet ſhould I not deny, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ſollicitude may be greater in behalf of a mans own, then other mens children. A third reaſon againſt Prieſts marriage is the encumbrances of the world, and the cares of a family. But others affirm with great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that a wife takes off more cares then ſhe brings to a man; eſpecially him that is of the Clergy, and muſt keep a Family, as it often happens; and would mind other imployments. And it is very rarely found, that men of that function, who keep houſe; and conſequently are neceſſitated to keep a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſervant in their houſe, do void the ſcandal, if the ſin it ſelf of an unchaſt life. And now I appeal to the judgments &amp; conſciences of the Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon the impartial weighing of both Caſes, that of the ſecular Prieſts abſolut interdiction of marriage, &amp; that of liberty granted to marry: whether
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:55232:215"/>
they really and faithfully believe there is more chaſtity in that Church where it is prohibited, or in that where it is permitted? I willingly grant that many, according to their Vows, keep their Veſſels in ſanctification and honour. But muſt withal crave leave to preſume that ſo many more walk quite contrary: that it may be feared, God is much more diſhonored by impoſed Celebacie, than permitted Matrimony: And if ſo, how can the Church in reaſon exact an oath of Virginity from all Prieſts, which tends to the violation of the ends of ſingle life, Chaſtity? This conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ends and moſt general event of ſuch laws are quite beſides the forms propounded, hath prevailed ſo far, with the ſoberer and more judicious of the Roman Church it ſelf, ſuch as <hi>Gerſon, Panormitanus, Caſſander</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who dare not ſpeak their minds ſo freely, That what was at firſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Caſſand. Conſult. c. 23.</note> and devoutly conſtituted by the Church, may with no leſs reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be now reverſed. And to this <hi>Caſſander</hi> doth add a ſecond reaſon, the great diverſity of the Churches frame now, from what it was when ſuch conſtitutions or cuſtoms rather, at firſt, prevailed. And to this he adds a third reaſon for the relaxation of ſuch laws; <hi>viz. From the detriment of the Church, where ſuch Chaſtity is commanded and rigorouſly exacted, without ſuch groſs connivances as are undeniable: That many ſober and eminent perſons for learning, and other worths, would be conſtrained to ſeek ſome other courſe of life than the Prieſtly; to take that liberty which otherwiſe they may.</hi> But I ſhall not need to proſecute this ſubject any farther than that grave Author hath done, to whom I commend the Reader: concluding, that though it ſeems very unſafe for men, unſerviceable for the Church, unrighteous in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners, and not at all to the glory of God, or honor of Religion, to deny entrance to all that refuſe a vow of Chaſtity into the Church; yet, at the worſt, it is neither Heretical nor Antichriſtian, ſo to do; but tyrannical ſimply. And it is little better than heretical for any to deny the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of true Virginity, above true Chaſtity in marriage; or that it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man, upon good advice, to take a vow to perſevere in that eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in anſwer to ſuch (for too many now adays of ſuch are to be found) who may well be thought to deliver their opinions againſt the marriage of the Clergy, out of Policy rather than Piety; and out of ſpite and envy, that they ſhould enjoy any thing of the world which pleaſes them ſo well; rather than out of any ſincere wiſhes to Religion or the Church, ſaying, <hi>It is not ſit Miniſters ſhould marry. What ſhould they do with Wives?</hi> and a great deal of high and boiſterous ſtuff, to this purpoſe; I ſhall refer them that argue out of conſcience and ſincerity, for ſatisfaction to what is ſpolem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready about this: But to the pretended States-man I ſhall offer this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That all politickly given (as almoſt who is not that hath been at a Coffee-houſe?) do lay it down as a Rule of their Polities, the encreaſe of People in the Nation: Now a general complaint being made of want of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his Majeſties Dominions, can they look on it as nothing, or no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Civil State, that twenty thouſand perſons (for ſo many, and more I may well number of the Clergy in all his Majeſties Dominions) ſhould be reſtrained from lawful marriage, and adding of people to the Nations under him? For my part, I uſe not this argument but to ſhow the vanity and madneſs of certain looſe tongu'd perſons, who regard little what they ſay againſt Religion, and thoſe related more immediately to it, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you ſhall hear from them ſomwhat religiouſly (as it were) ſpoken, when they intend thereby to miſchive and abuſe it. But I hope it will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to them, if we acknowledge that <hi>Holy Orders</hi> do bring a man into
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55232:215"/>
ſuch a peculiar ſtate of ſerving God, and obliging of ſelf-denial, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf to God, in not only ſober, but ſevere living, and not only ſevere, but ſpiritual; that what either of Precept is required of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or of Counſel obliges them, do much more firmly bind a Prieſt. And of this, the ancient and holy Fathers have written ſo much, that to add were hard at any time, and to alledge unreaſonable at preſent. Yet ſhall I crave leave to end with this diſputation of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thus rendred. <hi>Thou thy ſelf, ſaith the Heretick</hi> (againſt whom he had before argued) <hi>forbiddeſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. By no means. Far be it, I ſhould be as mad as you: How then doſt thou exhort me to marry? Becauſe I am perſwaded that Virginity is much</hi>

                     <hi>better than marriage, I do not therefore place marriage amongſt evil things, but I commend it highly. For it is the haven of Continence, to ſuch as will uſe it aright, not permitting nature to be outragious. For prefixing, as bounds, lawful</hi> mixture, <hi>and hereby receiving the waves of Luſt, it ſecures and preſerves us in great calmneſs. But ſome there are, who not wanting this ſafeguard, inſtead of this, do tame the madneſs of Nature by faſtings and watchings, lodging on the ground, and ſuch like hard uſage:</hi> Theſe <hi>I exhort not to marry, not forbidding</hi> them <hi>to marry. But there is a vaſt diſtance between theſe two, even as great as there is between neceſſity and choice. For he that adviſes, ſuffers his hearer to be maſter of the choice of his own matters, concerning which he gives counſel: but he that forbiddeth, taketh away from him this power. Moreover, I do not, in exhorting, do wrong to the [other] thing: nor do I condemn him that is not perſwaded by me. But you ſpeaking evil, and calling it wicked, and taking upon you the perſon of a Law-giver, and not of a Counſeller, in all likelyhood do hate thoſe that will not be perſwaded by you. But I nothing ſo; but admire ſuch as liſt themſelves for this combate; but I accuſe not them who continue out of this conflict. For then only doth accuſation take place, when a man tends to that which is naught. But he that attains to the leſs good, not arriving at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deprives himſelf of the praiſe and admiration, which the other hath, but deſerves not to be blamed. How then do I forbid marriage, not blaming them that marry? I forbid fornication. I forbid Adultery, but not at all, marriage. Theſe indeed that practiſe ſuch things I puniſh, and drive them from the Body of the Church: But thoſe that do this, if they contain, commending I advance. For thus two benefits ariſe: One, that Gods Inſtitution is not ſlandered: Another, that the dignity of Virginity is not taken away; but rather appears much more honorable.</hi> Thus far he, and much more in the following diſcourſe, againſt both the condemners of Marriage, and contemners of Virginity.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE laſt ſtate of worſhipping God, which we mentioned, is that of Separation from the world, and devoting a mans ſelf more entirely to the fulfilling the high ends of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, under the wiſe, ſober, and ſtrict Diſcipline drawn out of the Word of God, and compleated from the wiſe and holy Rules and Obſervations of Gods moſt faithful, holy, and renowned Servants. This ſtate of life is by a current Antinomaſie ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peculiarly called <hi>Religion:</hi> which name may ſeem to imply much of Arrogance and Pride, if it be ſo given to that State, as to undervalue the ſecular ſtate of ſerving God, as not worthy the name of Religion, compared with that, commonly called <hi>Regular.</hi> But if no more be thereby intended than a certain degree of living holily to God and his ſervice, that preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be paſſed over. For according to its firſt Inſtitution and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no queſtion can fairly and reaſonably be made of the excellent uſe and ends thereof; it being no other than <hi>Thomas</hi> deſcribes it to be, <hi>viz. Status</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thomas 22. Qu. 187. 6. co.</note> 
                     <hi>Poenitentiae &amp; contemptus mundi: A ſtate of repenting and contempt of the world.</hi> And as we may ſo ſpeak, that though men of one profeſſion may ſometimes do the work as well, and ſometimes better, of another trade, than he whoſe proper calling it is; yet this is no rule to deny it needful to be bound to ſuch a Trade; ſo in Religion, no doubt is to be made, but many living in the <hi>world</hi> (as they ſpeak) may exceed in holineſs and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diverſe who live ſecluded, as to outward profeſſion, from the world; yet this is no good argument to conclude therefore ſuch a life is vain and needleſs, much leſs that it is ſuperſtitious, and worſe then I will ſay after ſome light heads and looſe tongues. For in truth it is the trade to which Monaſtical perſons are bound all their lives; the more conſtant and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſervice of God: And if they do not profit more therein then other perſons converſing in the world more buſily, they are worthily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as well by Man as God. But as before, againſt the Clergy, againſt vowed Celebacie, ſo here againſt Monaſtick life, for men to rake in the Canals for durt and filth taken from ſingle perſons, to caſt in the face of the Orders themſelves; and to cry not only them down, but all the moſt eminent ſervants of Chriſt from the moſt primitive Ages and downwards for many Ages, who have either been ſo <hi>Aſcetical</hi> themſelves, or unanimouſly

But God forbid any man ſhould think men may not live at leaſt as civilly and ſoberly in Monaſteries as in private Families, or Kings Courts; which, I hope, ought not to be ruined and deſtroyed for abuſes their reigning. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in an Epiſtle calls Monaſteries <hi>The ſhops of Vertue, Abſtinence, Faſting, Patience, and Labours,</hi> &amp;c. Yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh thus clearly and ingenuouſly of them, in an Epiſtle likewiſe: <hi>I ſpeak unfeignedly to your Goodneſs, before our Lord God, whom I call to record upon my ſoul; ſince the time I began to ſerve God, that as I could ſcarce find any better than ſuch as have profited in Monaſteries, ſo have I no where found any worſe than they who in Monaſteries have fallen.</hi> Yet, though this were granted, they never took up an opinion againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick life, abſolutely. <hi>A few years ſince</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> in another Epiſtle) <hi>there aroſe at</hi> Rome <hi>one</hi> Jovinian, <hi>who is ſaid to have perſwaded certain holy Nuns, even grown into years, to marry, not enticing them ſo far as to take any of them to wife; but by arguing that Virgins devoted to holineſs, found no greater reward from God than faithful married perſons.</hi> For ſuch his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Jovinian</hi> fared never the better amongſt the primeſt Fathers of the Church: and ſtill we hold to this Rule not eaſily to lend an ear to modern Reformers, how eminent ſoever, againſt the torrent of more eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>There are three things ſpecially to be obſerved in Monaſtick Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we may judge of the reaſonableneſs and piety of the ſame: 1. The Original. 2. The Form or Manner of Living. 3. The End and Effects of it.

Before St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s time (ſaith <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi>) Monks were left to their own liberty, and ſo were Nuns too, to continue in, or relinquiſh that ſtate, as they pleaſed; as appears from many inſtances might be given. But ſuch as had once profeſſed or pretended ſuch a ſtate, and after deſerted it, were judged by all moſt infamous, and fear of ſhame had the force of a Vow upon them: nevertheleſs, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> brought them into a Society, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rules unto them, and brought them under that threefold Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, Obedience, and Poverty, which hath continued unto this day.

So ſhould the ſeveral orders and profeſſions be preſerved, and appear diſtinct by their outward garb, to advertiſe them of their duty and profeſſion; and a we them, before the eyes of all men, to a walking conformable to their profeſſion, others to be ſubject to juſt cenſures and reprehenſion of men, and none but low and ignoble Chriſtians do malign and oppoſe them. And that it ſhould be indecent, or as they would fain, but in vain quarrel with ſuch outward Habits, unlawful, is ridiculous to affirm, and a greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of more ſuperſtition lurking in the ſouls of theſe ſcandalized perſons, than can be found in the thing accuſed.

And in truth I do not determine any thing in this caſe.

I might begin with the exceſſive number of them, to the prejudice of ſuch ſtates where they are planted. I might proceed to the nature of them, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible looſneſs tolerated in them, of which ſo many Authors have too juſtly complained; and continue to declare the intolerable ſtrictneſs of ſome, either requiring a groſs Diſpenſation to the voiding of the expreſs will of their Founder, or to the ſhortning the dayes of many perſevering in the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55232:217"/>
rigorous obſervation of them. The very rules likewiſe themſelves are, many times, moſt ſuperſtitious. And above all, the foul uſurpation the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath over them, to the diſobliging them from their proper Biſhops, and thereby making them Schiſmaticks, and himſelf a Tyrant, it being certain, that of old, both by courſe, conſequence, cuſtome, and Canons of the Church, all Monaſteries and Religious Societies were, and ſtill ought to be ſubject to the Biſhop of that Place where their Site was. And to this purpoſe is there expreſs proviſion made by a Council of <hi>Ments</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle age of the Church, under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in the ninth Chapter, that the Monks of Religious Houſes ſhould be ſubject to their proper Biſhop, and do nothing without his approbation. But it is one thing to plead in general for the lawfulneſs and expediencie of Monaſtick Life, and that of both ſexes; and another to deliver laws and due preſcriptions for the well diſciplining of them: which is the work of the wiſeſt heads and ſincereſt hearts to Religion, to be here paſſed over.</p>
                  <p>There may yet ſeem ſomewhat due to an objection againſt the ſaid ſtate taken from the vow exacted from ſuch as enter themſelves into it: which no wonder that they who oppoſe ſo blindly the thing it ſelf, ſhould much more oppoſe. But they who approve of it, can find little reaſon to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at that bond. And that firſt, becauſe ſuch Monaſtick Life is not alwaies in Society, which they call Convents, but may be undertaken at a mans own pleaſure, both for time and place and other circumſtances: every Chriſtian having power to diſpoſe of himſelf (not prejudicing the general right and inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

But if a man reſolves to become a member of ſome ſpecial Society, already formed by certain Rules and Laws; to deſire to be matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated into that Body, and not to be willing to conform to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, is unjuſt and unreaſonable. And ſo Pikewiſe, not to give that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word and common aſſurance of faithful ſubmiſſion unto the ſame, by an Oath of Vow. For do men think it reaſonable, that Prentiſes ſhould be bound to be true, faithful, and keep their Maſters ſecrets, even before they know them, and when they know them to be none of the juſteſt or honeſteſt; or ſhall men that enter but into civil Companies, be it but of Merchant-Taylers or Barber-Surgeons, be conſtrained by Oath to be true and faithful to them, but they who are admitted into Religious Societies, be left to do and live as the pleaſe? What were this but to ſeek an occaſion, under colour of friendlineſs and good affection, to divide and deſtroy it? as is apparent in the ſeemingly modeſt pretenſes of diſſenters and diſaffected perſons to our Church: who upon condition that they may give and reverſe certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and laws, offer themſelves to become one with it: Thus the Vulgar take it, but in truth, it is for the Church to be one with them. And is not this a notable piece of modeſty, condeſcenſion, and complyance?

                     <p> Of Religious Worſhip, the third thing conſiderable in it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Exerciſe of it, in the ſeveral kinds of it: And firſt of Prayer the chiefeſt Act of Gods Worſhip: contrary to Sectaries who are Enemies to it in three reſpects. And first by their vain conceit of Preaching, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not the proper Worſhip of God, as in Prayer.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE third thing wherein the worſhip of God may be ſaid yet more properly to conſiſt, is the <hi>Kinds</hi> of Worſhip: And theſe we ſhall reduce to three; Prayer, Preaching, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the due exerciſe of all Chriſtian Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, wherein the Life of Faith properly conſiſteth. And firſt we ſhall begin with prayer, as that wherein was ever thought the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God principally to conſiſt, be that Religion Chriſtian or Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; unleſs we be forced to except ſome modern and immodeſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Reformation. For though they keep within ſuch bounds, as a grave and judicious defender of our Church ſays, none ever exceeded, not to deny prayer abſolutely, yet have they brought it to that paſs, ſo humbled and diluted it, that there is little place found for it, and leſs value. And ſurely, were they but true to their own principles and arguments, no uſe at all would they acknowledge of prayer, more then certain Heathens and Hereticks whoſe arguments muſt needs be accepted by them, if they will believe conformable to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <hi>There is ſprung up here a certain</hi>

Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> likewiſe tells us, that one <hi>Prodius</hi> was<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexa. Strom. 7</note> Authour of that Opinion. Thus far profane Sectaries amongſt us have not generally proceeded, though we have been credibly informed that ſome have. However, they unanimouſly conſpire to debaſe prayer, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Chriſtian worſhip it ſelf in theſe three Reſpects. Firſt, in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing preaching much inferiour to it, in a Church become Chriſtian, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before it. Secondly, by oppoſing <hi>Set,</hi> or <hi>Preſcribed</hi> Forms of Prayer. And thirdly, in expunging the Lords Prayer out of their uncertain and wild Liturgies. Which the Presbyterian Sect, the Sire of all others, was not a little guilty of; and ſo ſeldome uſed it, that being demanded why they left it out in their prayers, thought good to give ſuch a modeſt reaſon as
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55232:218"/>
this, They feared they ſhould be out in the recitation of it: ſo had they accuſtomed their tongues to liberty, and variety of words. But they had other reaſons which they were aſhamed to utter, but to their truſty friends.</p>
                  <p>But let us firſt ſee how preaching tranſcends prayer, and hath inſulted and trampled over it. For ſuch have been the extreams of late, that whereas formerly the Proverb was, <hi>No Penny no Pater Noſter:</hi> now, <hi>No Preaching no Pater Noſter:</hi> No Sermon, no Prayer in Gods Houſe. And whereas it was ſaid by our Saviour Chriſt of old, and by the Prophet before him, <hi>My Houſe ſhall be called</hi> (which almoſt every ordinary man knows accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 3.</note> the Hebrew Idiom, is the very ſame with <hi>ſhall be) the Houſe of Prayer unto all Nations;</hi> and never was it called or accounted a preaching houſe, but by them that called it a Steeple-houſe, and little otherwiſe judged of it; now have things been ſo reformed with a witneſs, ot rather a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that Sermoning carries all afore it, bears all down to little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>But what if all this while preaching be not the worſhipping of God at all? Will they continue ſo obſtinate as to make it almoſt the only thing in Gods houſe? That they, who with ſtrange boldneſs profeſs, and in conſtant practiſe declare they will have nothing to do with Gods houſe, as Gods houſe, but only as a Veſtry-houſe, when they are to take the Pariſh Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, unleſs there be a Sermon, do hold that Sermoning active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, preach'd and heard, is the main matter of Religion, and worſhip of God, is apparent and undenyable; and that it is only for the Sermons ſake, that ever they meet as Chriſtians in the Church. Now, if it doth appear that this ſort of Religion is no worſhip of God at all, and that God is not ſerved at all by that, by which they imagine they ſerve him entirely, what becomes of theſe mens Chriſtianity it ſelf? For Chriſtian Religion, as this whole work proves, conſiſts of Doctrine and Worſhip: and if they have not both of them, they cannot be Chriſtians. And if they have no prayer, they have no worſhip; and if they reſt on preaching, as that which contains all, they looſe all. For in making, or hearing a Sermon, we ſerve not God at all, in propriety of ſpeech, but rather he ſerves us.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs we have propounded preaching, as one of the kinds of worſhip; but intended not ſo to do as equalling it with that of prayer: but only reductively and remotely ſo calling it: as that whoſe end it is that God ſhould be worſhipped, and no other at all: And that which miniſters good matter, and preſcribes excellent manners and rules of worſhip, may by a figure, not unuſual, be called the thing which it ſo promotes, but in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech, it is not; nor in its own nature: the reaſons whereof may be theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe all true worſhip of God conſiſteth neceſſarily in ſomewhat of action, and not in meer paſſiveneſs. But hearing of Sermons, and ſo reading of Scriptures, or other good Books, have nothing of Divine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them; but the perſon therein concerned is meerly paſſive, and ſuffers ſomewhat, it may be, with patience and content to be done unto him, but himſelf does nothing. There is indeed ſomewhat of a natural act in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sermons, and reading Books, but this action is not, nor can properly be directed to God, but to a mans own ſelf, that he may make himſelf more capable of that benefit which he ſeeks thereby to himſelf: but this is to give nothing to God, but ſtill to be of the taking hand from him: But in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worſhip we are to exerciſe ſome act towards God: For hearing is not doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:55232:219"/>And ſecondly, All worſhip of God requires ſomewhat exhibited unto God as our ſervice due naturally to him, but in hearing of Sermons, we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nothing at all to him: therefore we ſerve him not at all; but rather we receiving thoſe bleſſed means of ſerving him and attaining grace here, and glory hereafter, He, at whoſe appointment and charge this is done to us, doth ſerve us, and do us honour, and not we him: though as (he that ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turns his bach and ſtops his ear againſt the words of his betters) we may be ſaid to diſhonou and ſin againſt him, if we refuſe to hear his Law: according to that of <hi>Solomon, He that turneth away his ear from hearing the</hi>

                     <hi>God.</hi> But ſtill the true ſervice of God conſiſts in offering ſomething to him: there being no difference in the nature of the Service or Sacrifice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God under the Goſpel, from that under the Law, but only in the matter. This was material and corporal; that is to be ſpiritual; but yet an offering. God laid a charge upon his people of old, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord empty:</hi> Meaning ſurely, that none ſhould believe they had done their duty in any competent manner, when they came to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there ſaw what was done, lik'd it well enough, heard what was ſaid, but offered nothing themſelves: God would have no ſuch ſervice. But ſuch like ſervice do they give to God, who come to Church and only hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: for they come empty to him, and perhaps to be filled with good things, but what, think we, will that ſtand for, when he requires that we ſhould be offerers, as well as receivers, and doers as well as ſufferers? And whereas in the true ſpiritual Sacrifice, we pray to God; In preaching, according to the language of the Scriptures, God prays to us. For ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, Now then we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God.</hi> And truly, God often complains of the empty and ſuperficial ſervice of the lip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart; but yet even that, as dilute a thing as it is, hath much more of worſhip of God, than hath hearing of Sermons. For that is an outward part, but this is neither outward nor inward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The means only of ſerving of God is not the ſervice of God it ſelf, no more than the means is the end. They whoſe religion lies in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing, do very aptly and currently call Sermons the <hi>Means,</hi> in a ſignal ſenſe. I ſuppoſe they intend thereby <hi>the Means</hi> to Salvation, and <hi>Means</hi> of Grace: and ſo indead, Teaching and Inſtruction are, according to that ſpecial place upon which all their good opinion of Sermons above prayer is grounded: <hi>viz. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>of God.</hi> 'Tis moſt certain: but muſt that which is firſt in order, be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe firſt in honour too? Or that which is moſt neceſſary, be moſt excellent? Yea, that which is excellent only as a way and means, carry it from the end which it ſerves, and is deſigned to? This is ſuppoſed, or nothing is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but this is weakly taken for granted, and therefore the concluſion from thence muſt needs be weak and pitiful. The Grace of Nature, which I call Reaſon, is much more neceſſary in the ordinary way of Gods ſaving us, then the Grace of the Goſpel, Faith: becauſe without that humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of what is delivered, no man can believe what is ſaid: and ſo the hearing of the Ear, than Reaſon, becauſe Reaſon depends upon it: and ſo doth Faith on preaching, and the worſhip of God on preaching going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55232:219"/>
and directing to do it aright, is it therefore any more then they, the worthier? or is it at all the very ſervice of God? The quite contrary is eaſily proved from this very reaſon: ſeeing it muſt neceſſarily be, that the End is much more deſirable than the Means: and preaching is accounted rightly but as the <hi>Means</hi> to the means of Grace and Salvation, believing &amp; doing the will of God; as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath in a certain place rightly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>But before we can appropriate the worſhip of God to prayer in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to preaching, an Objection muſt be here noted, which calls in queſtion prayer it ſelf, as incapable of that little. For they may ſay that in prayer we offer not ſo much to God, as we receive from him. For prayer is a begging of favour and benefits of God. To which our Anſwer is, that taking prayer ſtrictly and preciſely for that one part of prayer, which conſiſteth in craving a ſupply of our wants, or deprecation only, then indeed this is<note place="margin">

But we are to take prayer in its uſual latitude, for all the parts of it: ſuch as Confeſſion, Deprecation of Evil, Petition of Good, Agnition, and Profeſſion of Mercies received, Thankſgiving &amp; Praiſe for all Gods hand of Grace towards us, and thus prayer is the offering up of a ſpiritual Sacrifice to God. An offering of our heart, and an aſſent of the ſoul to God, as ſome devout men and learned have defined it: And not ſo only, but in effect and intention, it, by acknowledging of the free mercie of God in outward or inward bleſſings received from him, is the rendring of them all to him again, and a Sacrifice of that back again, which once he conferred on us. Thirdly, prayer, and worſhip ſo properly called, bear the name of Sacrifices, from the ground of all prayers, though ſome parts of prayer be not ſo expreſly ſuch. For he that acknowledges the Omnipotence of God, the Omniſcience, Omnipreſence, the Alſufficiencie, doth thereby render unto God his due, but he that prayeth unto God, ſuppoſeth, and confeſſeth, and implicitly offers all theſe, as his duty to God. But whoever heard of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up the Sacrifice of a Sermon unto God? For,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If there be any thing of worſhip or the nature of a Sacrifice in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; certainly great Idolatry is committed by them; it being moſt manifeſt that preaching is offered to Man, and not to God: and if it be a Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, what can it be leſs? For what is more true and common then this, That in prayer men ſpeak to God, but in preaching they ſpeak to man. So that from hence we may ſafely conclude that, that Religion which hath nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it but preaching, or nothing ſo much as preaching, is quite contrary to the Apoſtle, <hi>Whoſe praiſe is not of God but of Men:</hi> and in truth deſerves not ſo much the Name of Religion as of Superſtition, unheard of, unthought of, until of late years, and coming neareſt to that groſſeſt part of truly Popiſh Superſtition, or as ſome call it Sacriledge, communicating in one kind.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be warmly interpoſed and replyed; God forbid they ſhould oppoſe praying: it is a manifeſt ſlander. For theſe good people have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in private, and prayers in publick too. It is no proper place now, by and by it will be, to examine what manner of prayers &amp; worſhip theſe they mean, are; inſufficient (God knows) to the conſtituting of a Church in true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian communion: But here we tell them, that we have not diſputed againſt them as having no worſhip of God at all; But firſt, that at all they make preaching and hearing Sermons, a proper part of Gods ſervice: Secondly, that they make it the moſt eminent and chief: againſt both which our reaſons ſtand good ſtill: And that they ſo do, is demonſtrated from their practiſe, no leſs than Doctrines: in that they never (amongſt us) pray in publick, never enjoy Chriſtian communion, but by vertue of a Sermon.

And though being preſſed hard, they confeſs with much ado (as <hi>Cartwright</hi> againſt Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi>) that it is poſſible and valid to celebrate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſm and Euchariſt, without a Sermon; yet it ſeems ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inconvenient and incongruous, as it ought never to be done, where the Sermon is poſſible to be had.

                  <argument>
                     <p> A ſecond Corruption of the worſhip of God, not, eſpicially in Prayer: by oppoſing Set-forms of Publick Worſhip.

                  </argument>
                  <p>A Second thing whereby they have abuſed both the holy duty of prayer, and well-meaning Chriſtians, is in their traducing and prophanation of all preſcribed forms of prayer, wherein they forget not to ſhew themſelves in their arts and colours. For when the power is in their hands, and their Faction can domineer, then do they condemn directly in word, by preaching, printing, and covenanting ſolemnly againſt Set-forms in publick: and there hath been nothing under heaven acted by them more induſtriouſly than the utter abolition of all ſuch Divine Offices. And when they can go no farther, their Chariots wheels are taken off, and they begin to find themſelves to ſink: that they bethink themſelves how poſſibly they may ſtand in need of that moderation that they contemned, and that indulgence they condemned, their ſtudy is, not how to repent and retract abſolutely their former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly counſels and practiſes (as all good Chriſtians that meant ſeriouſly to be ſaved, ought to do) but with what artifices, they may, at the ſame time, hold to their old principles of miſchief to others, and ſave themſelves from harm from others. For we muſt not ſay now, they did any thing ſo diſorderly (good people that they are, and innocent) againſt Set-forms:<note place="margin">Province of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </note> but the Parliament (as they are obſtimately bent to grace their cauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground for ſuch a title) ſay they, call'd them to it: when of the two, they, if we may diſtinguiſh them from their pretended Parliament (for which there is no ground) rather called their Parliament to ſuch counſels and pranks, as they after play'd; as appeareth by their early <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> and their inceſſant inſtances with them to purſue thoſe Schiſmatical Dogms, to the ſubverting of all received Diſcipline, and forms of Worſhip. And that they have diſowned their principles, upon which they then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we find not; though we have more than enough of tricks and turnings,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55232:220"/>
and windings, and ſtraining them to the faireſt ſenſe they can poſſibly bear, and ſometimes farther too. For inſtance, they ſay now, their Covenant was not againſt Epiſcopal Government; but an Hierarchy. They ſay, They are not againſt Set forms; for they ſuffer them in private. Nay, they ſay, they are no enemies to publick Forms, nor many other Rites; but they would not have them impoſed upon any. But we ſhall preſume to tell them, we neither believe the one nor other; until they as publickly retract what they have done in depoſing all Set forms, and taught and writ, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Unſet forms upon all that would live by them. And in that they would not have them now impoſed, they imply more ſtrongly they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them wholly, than they expreſs they any wayes favour them; when, God be thanked, as ill as at preſent it is, it is not in their power to oppoſe and damn them, as formerly. Can there be any thing more ridiculous than for men to do as much miſchief as poſſibly they can, and then to ſay, They are not for doing any more, or going any farther. Which yet we might without cenſure of ſtupidity believe, but that they ſtand to their Arms ſtill, though it be no time to uſe them, yet: and their reaſons, which in brief are theſe, they hold not yet unreaſonable.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, Firſt, it was alwayes permitted to the Miniſter to <hi>modifie</hi> (their own word) the worſhip of God. And therefore they ought not to be preſcribed; now, any ſuch Forms as are propounded and enjoyned.</p>
                  <p>Will they ſtand to their principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing is now to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which hath prevailed much more generally and anciently, than this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Liberty of the Miniſter? Alas, it will not be endured by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it will prove too hot for them, it will make too much havock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their beſt Innovations. But we pardon, and paſs by their incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies in that, and the like grounds; in ordering which, they are ſeldom ſo ſollicitous how to ſecure themſelves, as intent how to wound their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But we more openly profeſs the contrary to that they take here for granted: and ſay, <hi>It was never permitted Miniſters to make any private</hi>

                     <hi>Prayers of their own, in the publick Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, ſince there was a ceſſation of thoſe miraculous gifts,</hi> which St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> affirms, upon this occaſion, to have been extinct, ſo long before his dayes, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from whence ſome would fetch extemporary prayers were very obſcure; it being unknown what was the practiſe of the Church then. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Gifts, he grants there were, at the firſt; but knew nothing of ſuch in his dayes: nor well underſtood, as himſelf profeſſes, what manner of ones they were when they were in uſe. In the next place we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire farther after them. Here we ſtick to this unſhaken foundation, That there is no footſtep of Record or Monument in the Church of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can make it probable, that in the ſolemn and ſet Aſſemblies of Chriſtians conſtantly obſerved (for as for inferiour, and voluntary, and undetermined meetings, they can be no rule to us at all; though ſomething more than we can find, ſhould be alledged againſt us) it was never allowed the Prieſt (whom I ſuppoſe they mean by Miniſter, though this word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were pleaſed to reform the language, as well as manners of the Church ſignified properly the Deacon) to utter any thing of his own, or indeed others compoſing, whether premeditated or extemporary, without the approbation of his Biſhop firſt had; I mean in the matter of Prayer, which we now ſpeak of. So that I wonder much, how any ſuch bold and untrue Axiome could ever enter into their minds, as that Miniſters might of themſelves <hi>modifie</hi> the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:55232:221"/>But the ſecond argument of theirs, taken from Scripture, may perhaps a little relieve them: where we read in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will pray with the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Spirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the Spirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</hi> To both which, we anſwer, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with what preſumption they take for granted, that, where ever the Spirit of prayer is mentioned, is intended conceived prayer, and not that formed to our hands. We grant, not only that there is a Spirit of prayer, but that this Spirit is neceſſary to have our prayers well ordered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. But we are far from granting, that the Spirits office muſt be ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as to ſuggeſt words, and eloquent affecting phraſes. No ſuch matter. The Spirit aſſiſteth and enableth us to pray, in ſanctifying our minds and hearts: in giving us the grace of prayer, and cauſing us to put up fervent and ſpiritual cries to God, even in ſuch words as we may have prayed over a thouſand times, without ſpiritual affections, which alone can render a prayer accepted. And when the Spirit thus enables us to pray, it ſelf is ſaid to make interceſſion for us, as being the principal Agent. But it is ſaid alſo, <hi>We know not what we ought to pray for:</hi> and therefore ſurely there muſt<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> be more in the work of the Spirit than giving the due <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of prayer. I may well ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not at all of publick prayer (as I confeſs he doth in his words to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) but of private, ſingle, and occaſional Ejaculations, which I ſhall grant, as much as they modeſtly can demand, may be the gift of the Spirit, as well as the Grace (as they are wont, not very warrantably to diſtinguiſh, as we may ſee by and by:) but we are now ſpeaking, and the Controverſie is wholly, about ſet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and publick occaſions, and common to the whole body of the Church aſſembled together, and concerning this, we deny utterly, that either St. <hi>Paul</hi> ever intended we ſhould depend upon the motions of Gods Spirit to frame a Prayer for that uſe: or that a prayer unform'd and unknown is ſo much as to be endur'd in the Church, where Chriſtian communion is to be enjoyed. But ſecondly, we anſwer, That the Spirit doth ſufficiently teach them to pray, who never pretend to pray extemporary; yea, perhaps that never pray at all. We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought. Therefore the Spirit which hath given us the Word of God, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us the hidden things of God, and what his will is, hath withal ſufficiently aſſiſted in that particular, our Ignorances and Infirmities, and taught us, what we ſhould pray for? What more can we expect reaſonably from theſe words? I am ſure not Extemporarineſs.</p>

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55232:221"/>
underſtood not: but undoubtedly all knew what they ſaid, who ſpake by the Spirit of Tongues; but others often did not: and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth there, that whoever were ſo gifted as to ſpeak in unknowntongues, they ſhould either be altogether ſilent, or ſpeak by one or two Interpreters: and this is all they can make of theſe words, as the words going before and after plainly demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>But to Eccleſiaſtical antiquity they have recourſe next; and from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> they argue a Liberty to Prieſts to model the worſhip of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith (the place is known well enough) that the Preſident of the Aſſemblies <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, according as he is able, prays. But that this publick Officer was a Presbyter or Prieſt, and not the Biſhop himſelf, is more than they can prove, though it lyes upon them. For I make no ſcruple to grant but it was free for the Biſhop, who is the higheſt power in the Church, to alter ſeveral things in the form of worſhip, and to make forms of Prayer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigence of that Church he preſided over, but never was any ſuch thing allowed to the Presbyter; and no longer to the Biſhop, than a form of publick Worſhip was agreed to, and received: which we confeſs was not until the Gifts of Miracles were ceaſed, and then, not all at an inſtant, but by degrees, and by orderly conſultation, and good autority, as occaſion offered. There might alſo be ſome Liberty, even after ſuch proviſion made for the ſolemn ſervice of God, by ſome preſumptuous Prieſts taken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from ſuch Preſcriptions, but that ever it was left free to them to uſe, or not to uſe the ſame; or to add, or detract from them, no where appeareth.

For ſcarce do the leading Sectaries pretend to ſuch Gifts of the Spirit, as ſhould enable their wits to make Hymns extemporary; or ſo much as bring in a new Pſalm or Hymn into their Aſſemblies, unknown or unheard of to the commoner ſort. Surely their modeſty herein, that they have not dared as yet to offer any new Sonnet, though of praiſe and prayer to God, to their people (as they call them) by vertue of this gift of the Spirit, doth condemn their boldneſs in offering every day, new prayers; whereas there is the very ſame ground for the one, as the other; both in Antiquity and the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55232:222"/>
Scriptures. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks only of ſinging out of their own heads. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks as expreſly of ſinging, as praying by the Spirit: yet we hear nothing they have done to declare their ſpirituality in publick by way of ſinging, or cauſing any thing of their own deviſing to be ſung. But ſurely ſinging is no leſs a duty then praying: And if they find it difficult and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient for the people to take the ditty ſo ſet by them, from their mouths or hands; and from thence infer that it is not neceſſary. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: That is as neceſſary, and accordingly was ever practiſed in Churches, that people ſhould concur with the Prieſt in prayer too: and therefore ſuch ill-form'd forms as are made and uſed at the ſame time, are not fit for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſervice, becauſe though they may be tacitly followed, yet are they ſo ordered and invented, that the common ſort ſhould have no more to do with them than they may with muſical prayers and praiſes, which in heart they may conſent to, but in act, can only ſay, <hi>Amen</hi> to, as is permitted to the people in their extravagant prayers. Would the one be ſcandalous to thoſe of their Party? ſo is the other actually offenſive to us: and therefore we deſire to hear no more of ſuch matters: nor ſhould they expect to find relaxation of Duties from thoſe they are bound in Juſtice to obey, before they remove ſuch obſtacles of communion with them, to thoſe that owe them nothing but charity; and this principally, in reducing them from ſuch a fond admiration of themſelves, and groſs infatuation of others, by the colour of ſuch falſe gifts.</p>
                  <p>It would be too long and tedious to take notice here of all their reaſons againſt Set forms; which are of two ſorts: the one General againſt All enjoyned forms; the other, againſt the Engliſh Liturgy in Particular. Of this latter we ſhall ſpeak leaſt, and not much of the former: becauſe we will take them at their word, when they ſay, <hi>they are not abſolutely againſt Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies preſcribed;</hi> though we know they contradict themſelves ſufficiently.

Now every child of God, though he hath an honeſt heart, hath not theſe gifts. And therefore in want of them, may lawfully uſe a Set form of prayers; as a man that hath a weak back or a lame legg may lean upon a Crutch.</hi> This is the meaning and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſion of the modern Puritan; when he is in the beſt humour, and would be more generous than ordinary in his conceſſions. For which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him, ſaying, That it was never lawful, nor is lawful at this day, for any Miniſter in publick ſervice, to bring in his own conceived prayers, beſides the intention of the Church: And, that <hi>Thomas Cartwright,</hi> who, at <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

But if me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, utterance, knowledge, to which ſome (that have ridiculouſly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the ſubject of conceiving prayers, as if they would teach the Spirit how to ſpeak) do adde <hi>Fanſie</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> be required, how comes this gift to be owing to the Spirit, more than <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Orations, of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, what great pains he took with himſelf to pronounce well, and to compoſe aright.</p>
                  <p>But let us hear <hi>Perkins</hi> a little farther, anſwering an Objection; <hi>It is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Set forms of Prayer do limit and bind the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Anſwer: <hi>If</hi>

                     <hi>we had a perfect meaſure of Grace, it were ſomewhat, but the Graces of God are weak and ſmall in us. This is no binding of the Holy Ghoſt, but an helping of the Spirit, which is weak in us, by a Crutch to lean on:</hi> It had been much more reverently ſpoken if it had been ſaid, <hi>An helping us in whom the Spirit is, than, the weak and lame Spirit in us.</hi> It had been much more ſoundly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, to deny the ſuppoſition both of the Spirit, and the gift thereof, in men praying extempore; and by conſequence clear'd all fears and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of injuring the Spirit at all. Why do they ſo weakly and lamely take that for granted that the Spirit informs men generally to ſuch ends, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wants a Crutch or Staff to ſupport it more than that? We deny it; we deny it: And wonder how they will go about the making it credible. But we deny the fact, that ſo it is; and not the poſſibility, that ſo it may be: or that the Spirit is able to do ſuch wonderful things. Nay we deny, they are ſuch wonderful things as are pretended; or any more than for a very ſimple man to become an excellent workman in a curious craft, by applying his wits and labours to the myſteries of it. And ſeeing they talk ſo often at this day of Crutches and Stilts, making all creeples and lame in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who cannot, or out of humility and obedience to the Diſcipline which juſtly interdicts ſuch pretended abilities, will not vaunt what they can do; they ſhould do well to procure Stilts and Crutches for ſuch halting and weak reaſons as theſe are, to make men inſolent.</p>
                  <p>Here they are wont to come forth with their ill applyed diſtinction of <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of prayer: and tell us that the gift of prayer is to be ſought after, whereby we edifie the Church, as well as the Grace, whereby we edifie our ſelves. To which I anſwer by denying ſtill what they take for granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch preſumed gifts are neceſſary to the edification of a Church. I grant indeed that the Church was at firſt ſetled by gifts, or I ſhould rather have ſaid, founded: but continued and edified to this day ſo, I deny. I deny as a notorious and pernicious untruth, that ſuch is to be the conſtitution of Churches, that they ſhould be managed and maintained by the gifts of men, above what by the ordinary induſtry with Gods bleſſing may be common to all men. Yet more expreſly, I deny that any Society ought to depend upon any thing extraordinary in men, as this gift is cryed up for: For that which carries on the myſteries and majeſty of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, muſt be grave, ſober, regular, ſafe, and eaſie; even ſuch, as, they in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation report, <hi>children, women,</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> may perform; and not ſuch as are <hi>high, ſtaggering, uncertain, deceitful,</hi> as are theſe extraordinary gifts. For this barbarous argument is ill grounded, ſuppoſing that it is more the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or ſupernatural parts that qualifie the Miniſtry, than the power of the Keys given: which if we may ſuppoſe given to ſuch perſons, we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55232:223"/>
to be more fit perſons to miniſter in the publick worſhip of God, than ſuch giſted perſons. I ſay in the worſhip of God, becauſe there may be much more skill and ability required to the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God: For though preaching and travelling in the converſion of ſouls to God, be to <hi>ſerve</hi> God, as an act of obedience unto his will; it is not (as we have often ſaid) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, as is prayer: And to <hi>ſerve God</hi> in this manner being an addreſs unto men, who muſt be informed with great skill and induſtry, and then reformed in their lives and converſations, by ſedulity of Exhortation, more is neceſſary than a commiſſion ſo to act. Moreover, to their diſtinction of gift of prayer and grace, we add, That we acknowledge no <hi>gift</hi> of prayer beſides the <hi>grace</hi> of prayer. There may be a gift of ſpeaking, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, with fluencie and readineſs, and this is vulgarly miſtaken, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a gift of prayer, but it is no ſuch matter. For all the <hi>gift</hi> of prayer, as of prayer, is nothing but the grace of prayer, coming from the truly devout and ſpiritual heart, and not from the operation of the brain, as Elocution doth. And beſides, thoſe that have ſpoken moſt ſoberly &amp; truly of gifts, have determin'd the uſe of them particularly to the Church, and its edification; and not to have God for their proper object: but God is the object of prayer, &amp; therefore it is fully compleated in the grace of it, which in a larger ſenſe is Gods gift too; and is as conſpicuous in Set forms, as Extemporary.</p>
                  <p>But they argue farther in behalf of this manner of prayer, That it is a great edification of the people; much greater than Set forms, which cuſtom hath made ineffectual. To which I anſwer, That there is a great deal of truth in what they ſpeak, Firſt becauſe, not out of Grace, or the Spirit, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, man is much more apt to be affected with variety, that is inferiour both in kind and uſe, to conſtant fare, as with a ſtrange monſter, rather than with a well proportion'd creature, to which he hath been accuſtomed: And he that ſhall paſs by in a fools-coat party-colour'd, ſhall have more eyes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, a great many, than he that walks in a much more comely, coſtly, and grave habit. Men therefore ſhould rather correct their judgments, and mend their hearts, and bring them to conform to ſound forms of words, than to pleaſe them, in their carnal appetites, after novelties, no new occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring. But this is not all. We except much more againſt the matter and manner of their prayers, in that they have quite loſt and depraved the nature of prayer: For that they give ſuch looſe rains unto their tongues ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that inſtead of Confeſſion, Petition, and Thankſgiving, of which prayer ought principally to conſiſt, they fly out into preaching; and jumble and confound thoſe duties ſo together, that many times in preaching, they mourn and pray: and this is, with the wondering multitude, accounted the beſt Sermon. They likewiſe in their prayers fall on preaching, and this is the powerful praying: But they are to conſider, that to convert men, is not the office of prayer, but of preaching.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add but one of their Objections more, the reſt being eaſily ſolved out of the premiſes. They ſay, If a preſcribed Form or Liturgy had been good or profitable for the Church, Chriſt, without queſtion, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered one for his Church. To which, on the contrary, I return, If extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary conceived prayer had been ſo neceſſary, as is pretended, ſurely Chriſt would ſome where or other have ordained that we ſhould uſe extemporary prayers; and conceive that Sacrifice, juſt as we offer it: But the miſery of theſe Arguers is, that whereas the Scripture commends and commands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as prayer, not one, the leaſt precept have they been able to find through the whole Scripture requiring prayer extemporary: And
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55232:223"/>
then is not this an humane invention? Is it not Will-worſhip? But that Chriſt hath preſcribed a form, and matter of prayer too, we hold it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the two Evangeliſts. I know well they hold the contrary? What more equal and juſt way to find out the truth, than to hear both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Interpreters upon that doubt, to their dayes. Do they find any that ſay, the Lords Prayer is ſo a Rule or Form, that it is not to be the very matter of our prayer too in terms? If not: Is not this another humane invention, hammer'd out of the Crowns of perverſe and unskilful men? What would they ſay if this very Lords Prayer, as we call it, was by Chriſt himſelf drawn from ſome received forms amongſt the Jews, before Chriſts time? This is affirmed by divers very learned men in Judaical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities. They were ſet againſt it enough, and more than enough before, this ſurely would turn their ſtomachs worſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſhall we take leave here to recite that ſober and moſt probable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> concerning the uſe of the Lords Prayer. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

                     <hi>doubt the Apoſtles propounded the form of prayer delivered by Chriſt to the Churches, and required all to pray after that manner, although they themſelves uſed other forms of prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much may be ſaid in the defenſe and confirmation of the received forms of communicating in publick. But what more than what anſwers the vain cavils againſt it, which is done? Or the general concurrence of Heathen, Jewiſh, and Chriſtian practiſe? all which, where it can be ſhewed they had any common ſervice, ſhow that it was conſtantly determined, and of one form; and never changed, but by advice of Authority. Which to prove, becauſe the Affirmative is inſinite, we here put in a challenge to give any one inſtance to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> of any one Church, Jewiſh or Chriſtian, where the publick Service was arbitrary, and left to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prieſt or Miniſter to form or model as he pleaſed? He that ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with <hi>Gennadius Maſſilienſis,</hi> ſhall find, that one ſolemn point in his<note place="margin">Gennad. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil. Eccleſ. Dog. cap. 30.</note> dayes for the adminiſtration of the publick Worſhip, was this, <hi>to keep to the ſolemnities of Sacerdotal Prayers, which from the Apoſtles were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to the whole world, and were celebrated in all the Catholick Church uniformly, that there might be an agreement between the Law or Rule of believing and praying.</hi> And where there is a liberty to pray what men liſt in publick manner, there will ſoon ſpring up a liberty to preach what men liſt, and upon that, for the common ſort, to believe what they liſt; unleſs that Law of Arms, which themſelves have exclaimed againſt in Religion, keep them in awe.</p>
                  <p>For if we ſhould ſpeak truly and properly, they who have no publick, known, received form of Worſhip amongſt them, can have no Chriſtian Communion one with another; and therefore they deſire they know not what, and we ſhould do we know not what, if we ſhould joyn with them. I prove it thus: All Communion properly ſo called, is in prayer and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Sacraments, therefore ſignally called <hi>the Communion;</hi> and not at all, or leaſt of all, in Faith or Sermons; becauſe a man may believe as much as any Church or Preacher requires of him, and yet be a curſed Schiſmatick and Alien from the Church. But he that communicates in Prayers and the Sacraments, hath full conjunction with that Body, with which he ſo communicates. Now farther, to the intent that men may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one, they certainly muſt firſt know that one thing: For what is Communion, but a common union in One thing, which is a bond ſo to unite them? But where this is uncertain, moveable, and new as
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55232:224"/>
the day and hour in which it is produced, how is it poſſible men ſhould know it, or agree to it? And if not, How can they be ſaid to enjoy communion in it? Communion is much miſtaken if it be look't on as a thing tranſient, or conſiſting only in the act, and paſſing away with it, and ending, and coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the returning of the like act: but it is a thing habitual and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. So that if we ſhould ſuppoſe a man hath heard and approved (for no man, but he that means to be guilty of worſe than Popiſh implicit Faith, can approve a thing meerly future, as <hi>extemporary</hi> prayers are) ſuch prayers, and thereupon freely aſſented to them: How can this laſt longer than the very inſtant of having paſſed ſuch a ſentence? for before he heard them, he could by no means yield rational aſſent, and after he hath heard them, it can laſt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer than the ſound doth in his head, for at the next meeting he is as far behind, and to ſeek as before, and ſuſpends communion. But in forms once heard, judged, and compared with the Rule of Faith and Worſhip, a man holds conſtant, real, though not actual Communion exerciſed, with that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of which he is a member. And upon common humane probability, may with general devotion joyn with, and in ſuch ſervice of God, though he be out of hearing: eſpecially (which is moſt eaſie) being acquainted with the method of the Liturgy and the purport of the ſeveral Actions, Poſtures, and Geſtures relating to the ſeveral parts thereof. And can theſe men in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience require, that we ſhould joyn with them who are ſo ill ſet together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, as to have nothing more than a blind preſumption and credulity that all is, or will be well.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhould we protract an argument of this nature, any longer againſt them, who are arrived to ſuch an unnatural height of admiring freſh phraſes &amp; inverted numbers of words, when the matter is much the ſame, that their own uttered conceptions to day, affecting themſelves and others wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lookt on as ſpiritual and divine; tomorrow, nay on the afternoon, nay next hour, ſhall be ſentenced by themſelves and auditors, as an humane invention, and injurious to God and Man? Nay, which is yet more, The form which Chriſt gave his Diſciples, and left to all to be practiſed, who would be his Diſciples, hath met with ſuch hard entertainment amongſt theſe illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones, that 'tis well it eſcapes a reproach, when it is rehearſed. Tell them here how the ancient and eminent Saints and Servants of Chriſt did uſe it in terms, and that daily, and that frequently every day, and that often in the ſervice of the Church in publick, you make the matter worſe for them. Tell them how diverſe of our own holy Martyrs bleſſed God for what they ſaw that day, wherein they were redeemed not only from blind obedience, but worſhip, &amp; had the comfortable opportunity of worſhipping God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this manner ſo contemned; they ſtick a little, and premiſe ſome ſmall reſpect to ſuch good men as would dye againſt Popery; but for ſuch devout and conſtant adherence to the Liturgy of the Church, they have no good words for them. But it muſt be either their unhappineſs, that they knew no better, their weakneſs, they were ſo fond of that, their want of zeal for a thorow reformation, and of light to ſee what they did, ſo clearly as they at this day: And many ſuch pieces of tattle have they in readineſs, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, nor judgment, nor charity in them, but declare plainly they who thus diſcourſe and practiſe to the contrary, are not of the ſame Religion with them: as to ſpeak what I hold my ſelf bound to profeſs, I am not of theirs, who refuſe ſuch publick communion with our Church; and hold it utterly unlawful to give ſo much as ear to them in their will-worſhip, and eſpecially ſuch as uſe that way in diſlike of &amp; oppoſition to the eſtabliſhed. And ſo let this end.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p> A third abuſe of the Worſhip of God by Sectaries in neglecting publick Prayers without Sermons, cenſured. That Prayer in a publick Place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Gods Worſhip ought at all times to be offered to God. Scripture and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition require it above that in private Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The frivolouſneſs of ſuch Reaſons as are uſed againſt it. The Reaſons for it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE come now to take notice of another inſtance of their injuriouſneſs to the Glory of God, in their vile and low opinion of publick Prayer in Gods Houſe. Whither it ſhould ſeem they would ſcarce ever invite Chriſtian people, but for the Sermons ſake. And this they may do for their own ſakes, becauſe they love to be encouraged (as who doth not) by a full appearance of Auditors. For whoever ſaw a Sectary at prayers alone in the Church, as was the manner, and ought to be the practiſe at this day of devout Chriſtians, even upon all occaſions to viſit Gods houſe of Prayer, to pour out their hearts before him, to put up the private requeſts of their ſoul to God there, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt place? I am aſhamed to hear, and much more to utter what they have to ſay againſt this excellent practice: 'Tis out of one of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places which fights againſt moſt of what they approve not amongſt us: and there's an end of it. It makes, I am ſure, ten times more for the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them whom they bitterly enough hate, then they are aware of. Shall all Jews be not only permitted, but excited to frequent Gods houſe even at thoſe hours of Prayer in which the publick Sacrifice was not offered? Shall the Apoſtles of Chriſt after the Reſurrection, as did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 3. 1.</note> in expreſs manner, and without all peradventure the reſt, who are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, obſerve the publick place, as well as common time of prayer: Shall our Saviour Chriſt himſelf often reſort to the Temple, and that of the corrupt Jews, to pray? Nay, ſhall this end be eſpecially mention'd as to which the Temple was ordained by <hi>Solomon,</hi> that men in private may offer<note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 38, 39, &amp;c.</note> up their Prayers to God? And ſhall it not become Chriſtians much more? We know not of any publick prayers the Jews had in their Temple at all: but he that ſhall prove they had any, even at their offering Sacrifice (which I neither poſitively deny, nor know of, but ſhould gladly learn from others) muſt, I am confident, prove it a Set form. But every man likely pray'd for himſelf, as his own heart and occaſions moved him, but commonly in a Set form. For when I doubted of prayer in the Temple, it was of any which was common, publick, or general, as with Chriſtians. So that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end of Gods houſe then, next to ſacrificing, was that particular men
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55232:225"/>
might come and worſhip God and pray to him. And to this end the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doors were not then only opened, when the Sacrifice was made, and that ended, clap'd to again preſently, to ſhut men out from praying there, at any time of the day. Nay, the doors of the Gentile Temples were not ſhut up againſt commers in to worſhip. And much leſs they of the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when a publick and peculiar place was appointed for their worſhip, whatever they were before. If it were ſo, that in the infant and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecuted ſtate of the Church, before Chriſtian Religion dar'd to ſhow its face abroad, the doors of places appointed for Gods worſhip, were ſhut from the time the ſervice was over, nay, and at the very time of aſſembling, will<note place="margin">John 20. 19.</note> they bring us back to that again? We find it indeed to be their Negative uſe of Antiquity and Preſcriptions. That if it cannot be prov'd that ſuch a thing was in uſe from the firſt beginning of Chriſtians, they hold themſelves ſufficiently exempted from the ſame: but if it can, they will not hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to do it: One of their fair dealings. But we think it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſufficient, in unqueſtionable Preſidents, to alledge them as imitable and binding, that ſuch were ſo early and general as could well conſiſt with the ſafety and advantage of Chriſtianity it ſelf, and its Profeſſours. And this we have, beyond all doubt, to favour and commend to us an open Church, even when there were no publick prayers (though that was daily) and much leſs a Sermon, which was rarely: and yet God ſerv'd (I ſpeak modeſtly) as well, as any where ſince the Reformation: and free, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acceſs was had to the Houſe of God to pray in. This was continued in all Ages, and all Chriſtian Countries, till ſome extraordinary Paſtours (as they call'd themſelves) made the alteration much for the worſe, God knows; and would have no man enter the proper place of worſhip, unleſs it were to hear the Word, that is, <hi>their word.</hi> This cuſtome (God be thanked) was never quite laid down in our Engliſh Church, and I truſt in God never will, but gain ſtrength, countenance, and encouragement, knowing that the Mother Churches or Cathedrals, being Precedents to all inferiour Churches pertaining to them, do by their example of daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a free acceſs at all convenient times of the day granted for men to pray to God, their private particular prayers, not only approve, but commend to and invite her daughter Churches to the like moſt godly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: All Eaſtern, as well as Weſtern Churches, out of the Precincts of the Reformation (herein very unhappy) ſet us the like example. And all Churches at firſt, by great prudence and piety of the founders and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters were there placed, where they might be moſt convenient for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to reſort to at all times: and alſo to the beſt advantage of Roads, that ſo travellers paſſing by might have an opportunity to enter them, and do the devotions to God. But now (a thing to be lamented) ſuch a godly cuſtom would be cenſur'd for ſuperſtition; as the Devil, and the Enemies of God never want words to traduce, where they want reaſon to diſprove what is good and commendable. And being born to an errour, have a certain horrour of leaving it, though no reaſon can poſſibly be picked up to retain it. Beſides, <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> what have any man (I would fain hear) to ſay againſt private prayers in Churches? And thoſe tearms are now ſo bald, and generally ſo boldly and ignorantly applyed, that they prove nothing more many times than the profaneneſs of the uſer; and have done the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more credit and ſervice, in that many excellent things have been made proper and ſingular to that Church, which in truth are not, then all the franck language, and moſt averſe practiſes of ſuch men, have done them diſcredit or hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:55232:225"/>But it were very ſtrange if they could here find nothing in Scripture to colour their cauſe, or credit this ungodly opinion. Chriſt ſaith (ſay they, or at leaſt may) <hi>Thou when thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhut thy door, pray to thy father which is in ſecret, and thy father which is in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> But do they, who turn theſe words thus to their purpoſe, really think that Chriſt hereby adviſed men to pray rather at home than in the publick? When I can believe it, I will ſhew the contrary, and before. For Chriſt ſpake not againſt the <hi>publickneſs,</hi> but the <hi>hypocriſie</hi> of this prayer. It is not probable indeed, that a man ſhould be ſo hypocritical in private, as he may in publick: And therefore, to obviate that mortal evil to all divine prayer, our Saviour both confutes and redreſſes it, ſhewing it is far better for ſuch, and more acceptable to God, to be take themſelves to their cloſets, where no Man, but God and their own Conſciences, can ſee them, than with ſuch vain oſtentation to beg applauſe of men. And if all the world were ſuch Hypocrites as Chriſt reproved, it were better no man ſhould ever come to Church at any time. But there is the contrary vice to be ſhun'd, and that is Profaneneſs. For that is no leſs, ſcandalous, yea much more, and muſt be ſo accounted. But they, who out of undue reaſons refuſe the publick place of Gods worſhip, are to be noted as Prophane.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that they who keep to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, That men pray every where lifting up holy hands,</hi> &amp;c. cannot pray<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8. Epheſ. 6.</note> always in one place, eſpecially if we add that other precept of St. <hi>Paul, Pray always:</hi> for no man can be always in that moſt common place of prayer. And therefore it may be inferred from hence, that it is lawful and acceptable to God to pray privately; but not that prayer in publick is not to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before private. For would it not as well hold againſt prayer in families, which is not in the cloſet? And if to every houſe there were a place dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſpecially to Gods worſhip, as there is in every pariſh, I ſhould hold that prayers generally in the family, and particularly of perſons ſingly, were more laudably performed in that publick place, than in a private chamber. But it is further to be noted, That when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, we ſhould <hi>pray every where,</hi> he never intended to equalize all places in fitneſs to Gods ſervice; he intended not to take off diſtinction of Chriſtian places to that end, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical, as the Temple of the Jews: which diverſe green Chriſtians ſuppoſed was to be the ſpecial, if not only place, aſſigned of God for his worſhip. St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs them better, &amp; aſſures them that they ſhould pray every where as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> meaning nothing leſs then that where there were Chriſtian Temples to which they might reſort, they ſhould not need go to them, but may keep at home as well, being God is every where, and they muſt pray every where; but that a place of worſhip ſolemniz'd by Chriſtians, was altogether as proper as that Temple of the Jews. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> ſaith indeed, <hi>Prayer is moſt opportunely made in private places,</hi> and is more pleaſing to God, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo qualified as before: A ſincere prayer at home is better, many degrees, than an hypocritical one in publick. And the Gloſs upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ith, <hi>In every place,</hi> that is, <hi>where ever you are, and not only in the Church.</hi> And the like it ſaith upon Chriſts words in St. <hi>John</hi> to the woman of <hi>Samaria, That neither</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 4. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>on that mount, nor yet at Jeruſalem men ſhould worſhip God.</hi> But who ſees not that it is to be underſtood ſignally, and not ſo ſuperſtitiouſly, as that a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not be as pleaſing to God in any other place, as at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or Mount <hi>Gerizzim?</hi> And I know he addeth, as divers other Fathers, <hi>the Temple of the heart,</hi> which is worthily ſaid, to encourage ſuch perſons to inward and chamber-devotion, whoſe leiſure or labours will not ſuffer them to repair to Church, not to erect an alter in heart &amp; houſe equal to that in the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55232:226"/>
Church. And for my part I ſee no reaſon to except unclean places from Gods worſhip, as ſome Caſuiſts do, when a more comely and convenient cannot be had? For there is no place unclean in ſuch Caſes. But we are now enquiring about the right, a place hath to our Services, other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal. As if a man hath as good an heart, as ſimple intention, as pure charity, as laudable matter petition'd for, whether the place of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be not it, he ought to offer his Sacrifice in, rather than any other? And whether publick is not required rather than private? And here it may be noted that we make publick prayer of two ſorts: Publick in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of manner, and publick in reſpect of place: The former, when there is an unanimous and orderly concurrence of many members of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in one common ſervice. The other, when one ſingle perſon appears before God in his Houſe, and offers his bounden ſervice and devotion alone. Both theſe we hold to be better than domeſtick or private worſhip of the ſame nature: and thus prove from reaſons not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for both generally.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the precepts of the Scripture much more often inculcate and more earneſtly preſs this, and more highly magnifie this office than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>O worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. This <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 96. 9. Pſalm 27. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of holineſs</hi> was undoubtedly the Temple. And again, <hi>One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</hi> And to what end was the Temple of God built and dedicated ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, but to receive the prayers of devout perſons, as well as ſacrifices, and the ſingers in order? Is there any thing more frequently repeated in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Oration, than the uſe of prayer, there eſpecially? And that they who<note place="margin">1 Kings 5. 8.</note> could not enter into the Temple it ſelf, ſhould direct and ſend their prayers thither? The Jews, it is well known, turn'd to their Temple generally when they pray'd, as <hi>Daniel;</hi> &amp; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he was ſick, is ſaid to turn his face<note place="margin">Iſaiah 38. 2.</note> to the wall, becauſe his houſe ſtanding with the Temple, he thereby turned his face that way. And I ſuppoſe upon this ground, which will be cenſur'd (I know) as ſuperſtitious, that they held opinion their prayers did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcend unto God, but by entring firſt into the Temple; which I gather from the prayer of <hi>Jonah,</hi> who being in the belly of the Whale, and the bottom of the Deep, cryed unto the Lord thus, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jonah 2. 4, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>yet I will look again towards thy holy Temple.</hi> Again, <hi>When my ſoul fainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, I remembred the Lord, and my prayer came unto thee, into thy holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> So that, wherever, or in what condition ſoever they were, they held themſelves obliged to offer their prayers up there firſt, as the propereſt place and means to have them aſcend unto God: and that</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe there were greater promiſes of audience of prayers made there, than in any other place: as it is well known from the prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the promiſes of God thereupon, in the Book of the <hi>Kings.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 8.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly, where there is a greater approbation and conſent in the worſhip of God, there is a greater confirmation of our Faith and Confidence that there we may offer up our prayers to God. But in publick worſhip rather than private, this is found.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in publick Worſhip a greater increaſe of devotion towards God is ordinarily occaſion'd at the conſideration of the ſpecial place of Gods worſhip, and the ſpecial preſence God hath promiſed in that place, in the hearing the prayer, obſerving the poſtures and behaviours, of all ſuch as appear before him, and in the diſpenſation of his graces there.

And 'tis no ſtrange thing for the Preſident or Biſhop to be tearmed an Angel: as (what ever <hi>Origen</hi> playing many times with the Scripture, rather than interpreting it, might phanſie) in the Revelation, and in other places of Scripture.<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The glory of God which (as hath been ſaid) is principally relative, is much more declared and celebrated by the publick than by private wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, even in the ſingle act of one, when occaſion is not offered for more, in the publick place of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this, I ſhall hear give the reaſonings of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to this our purpoſe, upon the occaſion of the effect of the joynt prayers of the Faithful in the delivery of St. <hi>Paul</hi> from death, mentioned in his Epiſtle to<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 10. Chryſ. Serm. 64. p. 662. 663 Tom. 6.</note> the <hi>Corinthians. If St.</hi> Paul, ſaith he, <hi>being in danger, was delivered by the prayer of the multitude, why ſhould not we alſo expect great benefit from ſuch aſſiſtance? For ſeeing, when we pray ſingly by our ſelves, we are weak, but when we are gathered together, we become ſtrong, we more prevail with God by multitude and auxiliaries. For ſo a King, who often gives one over to death, and yields not to one when he intreats for one condemned; but yields to the importunity of an whole City pleading for him; and upon the importunity of a multitude reſpites him that is lead to the Dungeon from condemnation, and brings him forth to Life: Such is the force of the ſupplication of a multitude. For this reaſon we are here gathered together all. of us, that we might more powerfully draw God to commiſeration. For ſeeing (as is ſaid) when we pray by our ſelves we are weak, by conjunction of Charity we prevail with God to give us thoſe things we crave. But I ſpeak not theſe things for mine own ſake, but that ye may daily haſten to the Aſſemblies, that ye ſay not, What is there that I cannot pray for at home? Thou mayeſt pray indeed, but thy prayer not have the like efficacie, as when it is made with the proper members; as when the entire body of the Church ſendeth up its Petition with one conſent, with one voice, the Prieſts being preſent, and offering up the prayers of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

Gods worſhip, againſt that, and all other Houſes to that holy intent, and to make all places alike, when there is nothing ſo manifeſt as, that that place was only aſſigned by God with ſpecial injunctions and promiſes? For when<note place="margin">Acts 7. 48. c. 17. 24. 1 Kings 8. 27.</note> they ſay, <hi>God doth not dwell in Temples made with hands,</hi> out of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles: what do they ſay more than <hi>Solomon</hi> at the time of dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much leſs this Houſe which I have built?</hi> Doth not the argument prove that God is no where to be worſhipped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is locally no where contain'd in a place? Or does it prove that he is to be worſhipped in private Houſes, or contained in them, rather then in the publick? The Gentiles (as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words intimate) imagined, that, by certain Images they could bind their Gods to be preſent, and limit them to certain places, from whence they could not well ſtir. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſome ancient Fathers, as <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> denyed, the Chriſtians had any Temples then, meaning ſuch charmed Images and Shrines, to hold God faſt to them. The Jews imagined (as appears by St. <hi>Stephens</hi> words) that Gods promiſes and bleſſings were ſo preciſely determined to that One Temple, amongſt them, that he would by no means impart himſelf in like manner, in any other place. To this fond and ſuperſtitious conceit, it was very proper to quote their own Prophets againſt them; who imply what St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes elſe where; <hi>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>alſo of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles alſo,</hi> &amp;c. And by vertue hereof, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Scripture may ſeem to ruder readers of it, to ſpeak by way of diſeſteem of material and viſible Temples, implies no more than an equal right of the Gentile Temples dedicated to God under the Goſpel, with the Jewiſh under the Law.</p>
                  <p>But that even the publick places of Chriſtians ſhould be looked upon with no greater reſpect or religion then that which comes next to hand, is no where to be found; and far from being the purpoſe of Chriſts words, out of which another exception is made, viz. <hi>Where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> For what I pray is it to meet in the Name of Chriſt? Only to take his Name into our mouths? To turn over the Scriptures, and to turn them this way and that way, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs great matters out of them? By no means. 'Tis true, this is ſomewhat towards it. But notwithſtanding this, men may meet in the name of the Devil rather than of Chriſt, and do the works of the Devil rather than of Chriſt. For to do the will and work of either, is to meet in the name of either. And no men who in their very meeting it ſelf, as ſuch are enemies unto Chriſt, can be ſaid to meet <hi>in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> ſpeak they never ſo gracious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things of Chriſt and Religion. But they who lightly, vainly, and cauſleſly affect ſeparation, and diſmember themſelves from the viſible, I ſay, viſible Body of Chriſt, the Society of Saints by Election and Profeſſion, are thereby direct enemies to Chriſt, and can never meet in Chriſts Name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts intention, though, as the worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> on <hi>Baal,</hi> they call on Chriſt, with never ſo much zeal and earneſtneſs from morning to evening; as we have already ſhewed where we treated of Schiſm: And when at length will they, who under ſuch obſcure and fond pretenſes ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, produce any one thing which may countervail the notoriouſneſs of the evil of ſeparation, as a reaſon to warrant them ſo to do? But this, either the groſs inſenſateneſs of the vulgar in ſuch points, or the deſperate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to hold their own, whatever may be ſaid againſt them, is little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing look't after, till it be too late.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p> A fourth corruption of the Worſhip of God by confining it to an unknown tongue. Scripture and Tradition againſt that cuſtom. A fifth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Prayer, in denying the People their Suffrage contrary to the ancient practiſe of the Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT before we leave this publick worſhip, we are to obſerve ſomewhat of the manner how it ought to be performed, and that to reſcue it from two abuſes principally crept into it. The firſt of the Papiſt, and the other of the Puritan, unluckily falling into the ſame condemnation with the other. Two things are as evident as Tradition, not to ſay Scripture, can make any thing; Firſt that all publick and private prayers were inſtituted in a known tongue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there was a concurrence of the vulgar Chriſtians with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſter of ſuch Offices. Both theſe are now quite, almoſt, worn out of uſe amongſt the Romaniſts, and being diſuſed, a defenſe framed ſtudiouſly againſt the practiſe of them: The latter hath been practiſed and maintained by Puritans, though firſt invented by Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>The authority of Scripture for the publick prayers to be made in a known tongue ſeems to us, and not only to us, but to our more ingenuous adverſaries, very expreſs in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> of the fourteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle is to redreſs the vanity of certain gifted perſons, who preſumed to teach and pray in ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign tongue, which no man underſtood but themſelves. For whereas it is commonly replyed by the Learned Romaniſts, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of preaching chiefly, and not of praying in publick: It matters not much if he doth ſpeak of preaching, as certainly he doth, ſo it be evident that he ſpeaketh of prayer alſo, nor that he principally teacheth of propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he omitteth not publick prayer. Is there any thing need be plainer than this, on our ſide, <hi>If I pray in an unknown tongue, my ſpirit prayeth, but</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>my underſtanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the ſpirit, I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo: Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt?</hi> Theſe words are plain enough, one would think, to declare that the Apoſtle intended pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer, as well as preaching or propheſying: Therefore no arts are omitted to obſcure and pervert his meaning, but with ſuch ill ſucceſs, that it is thereby much more illuſtrated and confirmed to the loſs of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Scripture, to make it agree with their doctrine and practiſe. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes, 'tis very hard to make it good, that the Apoſte means<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Verbo D. lib. 2. cap. 16.</note> only preaching; and ſo in truth it muſt needs be, but that there is nothing
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55232:228"/>
to neceſſity, and a willing mind. And therefore to mend the matter, he ſays, <hi>The Apoſtle there treateth not of Divine Offices, but of Spiritual Songs, which Chriſtians were wont to compoſe to praiſe God and give him thanks.</hi> And what if this were ſo? For that they had any formed Liturgies in thoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſetled dayes of the Church, while the gifts of the Spirit were ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, I much queſtion, excepting the Lords Prayer, which was ever in publick uſe, as well as private; if it be not undoubtedly true what is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no mean Authors, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> celebrated the Maſs (taking here Maſs in the ancient and innocent ſignification) with the Lords prayer only; Doth not the argument of the Apoſtles hold altogether as valid in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as extraordinary Praiſes and Service? But when the ſame Authour can bring ſcarce any ancienter than himſelf, who are of his opinion, and doth bring <hi>Haymo, Primaſius, Lombard, Thomas,</hi> and others, that he means the <hi>Ordinary ſervice;</hi> what worth can there be in ſuch an evaſion? Hence it is that another is invented in the ſame Authour, which acknowledges that there is meant <hi>Common worſhip:</hi> But that the whole Congregation is not thereby to underſtand, but only the Clerk of the Pariſh, who is inſtead of the unlearned or Idiot to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> For Papiſts make no doubt but ſuch an one there was who ſhould in ſuch manner anſwer for the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But I make no doubt but they are miſerably miſtaken. For no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords among the Jews, from whom moſt cuſtoms of the ancienteſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deſcended, report any ſuch thing: No cuſtom of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians warrant this, but the contrary; whatever <hi>Ledeſima</hi> the Jeſuit ſaith. For, as ſhall by and by ſhewed, the people in general without any ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination of perſons made their ſolemn returns unto their Biſhop or Prieſt, who ſo celebrated in publick. And therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> honeſtly and learnedly rejecteth this interpretation, ſhowing that the phraſe of the Apoſtle which we render, <hi>Supplyeth the place of the unlearned,</hi> comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no leſs, <hi>all the vulgar,</hi> then the pretended Clerk. And reaſon good he ſhould ſo think, becauſe queſtionleſs, by <hi>Unlearned,</hi> is not there meant general ignorance of men, but ignorance of that language which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo extraordinarily: For as <hi>Salmeron</hi> noteth upon the place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Place</hi> is meant the order of ſetting in ſuch Aſſemblies, where the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had one place, and the Hearers, who for that were called <hi>Unlearned,</hi> had another. Hence it is that <hi>Salmeron</hi> would make clearer work: affirming,<note place="margin">Salmer. Com. in 1 Cor. 14. Diſp. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is not the end of Divine Service that the people ſhould be inſtructed, but the worſhipping of God.</hi> This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> approveth, but betrays his cauſe in another point; granting that, of old, prayers publick were for the inſtruction of the people, but now (is not this to own a forſaking of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity) the chief uſe of prayers is not the edification or conſolation of the people, but the worſhip of God. And the Reaſon which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives, is exactly the ſame which Sectaries amongſt us give, to ſilence the people in publick Devotion, becauſe, <hi>The Miniſter ſpeaketh not to man, but unto God.</hi> To both which we anſwer briefly, and againſt both, <hi>viz.</hi> The Prieſt ſpeaketh unto God only in prayer, as the proper object, and to the people only in preaching, as the proper object of that: But he alſo in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpeaks to the people inſtrumentally, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to ſo many inſtruments or cauſes concurring to the ſame end and effect, and therefore ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is petitioned for, and obliged to concur with the principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, the Miniſter of God in ſuch worſhip.</p>
                  <p>For though we are far from denying what the Papiſts and Puritans may ſay, That any prayer is unfruitful or unneceſſary which is not underſtood by
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55232:228"/>
the people, in whoſe behalf it is put up; for it may avail them who are many miles diſtant, we all grant, and conſequently, a prayer not heard, may be uſeful, as well not underſtood, when heard: Yet this holds only when inconveniencies or impoſſibilities obſtruct the due exerciſe of prayer. For as to ſuch, who are deaf and cannot hear, yet come with general reverence to the publick place, and ſo far, as they can, joyn with the prayers of the Church, I make no queſtion, but conſiderable benefit to accrew; ſo ſuch as ſhall ignorantly, ſcornfully, or uncharitably neglect to give their general conſent and ſuffrage to the publick communion in prayer, I make no doubt but they bereave themſelves of the benefit both of the publick ſervice, and their own private worſhip. But this cometh not home to the purpoſe: For of extraordinary acts in Religion, as of particular things in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, there is no knowledge, and nothing can be determined; but this may, That generally and ordinarily, publick prayers are more prevalent with God when underſtood and concurred to by publick devotion. And herein doth conſiſt the vulgar errour of the Romiſh Doctours, that they ſuppoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould mean (which I confeſs, as I have ſaid before, our Tranſlation too much favours) that when he ſaith, <hi>The underſtanding is unfruitful,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the ſpeaker in an unknown tongue; whenas the context will certainly inform us, he meant the underſtanding of the hearer, who knew nothing of what was ſo delivered, which ſome of their own Expoſitors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to: as alſo they do to the great expediencie, as well as antiquity, of that cuſtom of the peoples bearing a ſhare in the publick Worſhip. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate which, I ſhall here at large tranſcribe what I find in ſober and learned <hi>Caſſander. It were to be wiſht, that according to the precept of the</hi>

                     <hi>Apoſtle, and the ancient Rite of the Church, that ſome conſideration were had of the people, in the publick prayers of the Church, ſingings, and leſſons which are undertaken for the peoples ſake: and that the common ſort of Believers ſhould not wholly and conſtantly be driven from all communion of prayers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine leſſons.</hi> St. Pauls <hi>words are manifeſt, that what is ſaid cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, unleſs you expreſs it by a tongue ſignifying your ſpeech: and that he who through ignorance underſtandeth not what is ſaid, can by no means anſwer Amen, at the giving of thanks of another. And that</hi> Oraculum <hi>by notice whereof the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>with the Senate of Cardinals, granted to the</hi> Sclavonian <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould uſe the tongue of their Country in ſacred actions, ſeemeth to pertain to all Nations named Chriſtians,</hi> Omnis ſpiritus laudet Dominum &amp; omnis lingua confiteatur ei. <hi>Let every ſpirit praiſe the Lord, and every tongue confeſs to him. And</hi> Thomas Cajetane, <hi>a man doubtleſs moſt learned and acute, wrote in a certain place, It were better for the edification of the Church, publick prayers to be ſaid in the vulgar tongue in the Church, which the people may hear, than in the Latin tongue: And when he was for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by ſome, he anſwered, He built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles, in his fourteenth Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far, and much more followeth, out of that grave man, to this purpoſe. So that in one of thoſe things which convince the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Innovation and obſtinacie in novelties, as nothing need more be ſaid againſt it to that end, nothing being ſaid more for it in the upſhot of all Diſputes, but that for ſome time it hath been in uſe there, and the <hi>Trentine</hi> Convention hath<note place="margin">Azorus Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. Mor. l. 8. c. 26. Salmer. in 1 Cor. 16. Diſp. 30.</note> made all ſure, according to their manner, by decreeing it inconvenient that Divine Offices ſhould commonly be in the vulgar tongue, as <hi>Azorius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and as <hi>Salmeron; It anathematizes, ſuch as will not be content with the three tongues in which the ſuper ſcription was written upon the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:55232:229"/>
Which is a fanſie without any firmneſs at all, it being certain no ſuch thing was intended thereby, and evident, that the Hebrew tongue was ſcarce ever uſed in Chriſtian ſervices, though the Syriack hath been. And it is not agreed whether of the two was the Language: but this we reſt not on: nor can the Romaniſts. But when they have turned every ſtone to little purpoſe, they come to that which will never fail them in this or any other point, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>their</hi> Church, and practiſe of the ſame, which upon no accounts muſt be violated, for that were to looſe or hazard all, as <hi>Azorius</hi> in the place fore-cited doth with little modeſty, and leſs advantage to his cauſe profeſs: and anſwering this queſtion, <hi>Whether the vulgar tongue might not be indulged to Hereticks petitioning for it, and for the peace of the Church?</hi> ſaith, <hi>I anſwer, Councils and Fathers and the Church were never wont to yield to ſuch like He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks demands.</hi> But this he proves in matters quite of a different nature, as if, when the Fathers would hear of no accommodation with <hi>Arius, Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, Neſtorius</hi> holding notorious hereſies againſt Chriſt (even when they would have introduced ſome verbal agreement) they could be precedents to oppoſe that wherein, if it were falſe, can conſiſt no hereſie; but is true and moſt generally was practiſed by all the Fathers and Churches at firſt, and ſo continued for eight hundred years. And therefore he ſpeaks more to this purpoſe in theſe words following: <hi>If it ſhould be granted to</hi> Lutherans <hi>and</hi> Calviniſts, <hi>that they ſhould celebrate Divine Service in their vulgar tongue, they would afterward give out that they had got their wills: yea, that the Church had changed her opinion, and left off her ancient cuſtom, as contrary to Scripture, and ſo charge the Church with erring: and would exult with incredible joy and gladneſs over it,</hi> &amp;c. This is in truth the very ſame reaſon which our grave Puritans render, why they conform not to the Church in her Service, whenas they confeſs they have nothing of ſin to object againſt the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> They ſhould be judged of mutability and levity, &amp; ſhould thereby weaken their Miniſtry in the eſteem of their people: which in all probability they borrowed from their Father <hi>Calvin,</hi> one of whoſe reaſons againſt the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Calvin. Epiſt.</note> of <hi>Melancthon</hi> was, that if they ſhould make any correction in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which was ſo haſtily hudled up, they ſhould weaken their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. The reaſonableneſs of which I leave to others to judge of.</p>
                  <p>But rejecting the common reaſons (all of which we are not here to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) of Papiſts, we ſhall freely oblige them to give better grounds of the Liturgies in unknown tongues, than may be ordinarily found amongſt them, though no ſufficient can be given. And one is the great veneration had to the traditions of the Ancients in worſhipping God: not that anciently any inſtance can be given, that may be a precedent to the corruptions of theſe times, but that having, with ſober, grave, and holy advice, framed a Liturgy in any one tongue, they were very ſcrupulous how they made any alteration therein, though of words only; and therefore that which is vulgarly ſpoken, altering daily, and that which was written remaining altogether unchanged in words, tract of time bred a diverſity between the one and the other. But this we demand of our Adverſaries, what one preſident for many hundred years together they can produce, where, at the firſt inſtitution of publick Service, it was ſo contriv'd that nothing of the vulgar language ſhould be taken into it? There is a vaſt difference between a paſſive and an active and purpoſed inconvenience. The ancient predeceſſours of the Roman Church never intended that their Latin Service ſhould be hid or unknown from the common people, which many generations after followed; yet ſo it muſt needs fall out in time.

                     <hi>Indies,</hi> and obtrude their Latine tongue upon the people there; and who deny liberty to other Provincial Churches in Europe, and elſewhere, to celebrate in their known Language, do purpoſe miſchief unto ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and become Schiſmatical, in not only not redreſſing themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule of their fore-fathers, whom they ſhould much more imitate in ordering their ſervice, ſo that the Common Chriſtian might underſtand the ſame, as primitively and for a long time they did; than in ſticking ſo ſeverely to the bare Letters and Syllables they uſed: not making conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of far more ſcandalous practices, in altering the ſervice it ſelf in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by abſurd additions and detractions: but with denunciation of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt ſuch Churches as ſhall preſume to redreſs that evil of ignorance, and render Chriſtians intelligent of what they do.</p>
                  <p>But I have been of opinion, that the vulgar have been no ſmall cauſe of this great ſuperſtition and inconvenience to themſelves: In that, in proceſs of time, their devotion ſlacking in timely repairing to the Church, and in due demeanor in the Church; neglecting to concur with the Miniſter of God, and to reciprocate with him, and almoſt deſerting the Service by coldneſs, ſloth, and indevotion; the Prieſt was conſtrained (perhaps with a Deacon or Clerk only) to perform the ſervice alone. And truly, let ſuch people look to their modern teachers, who have inſtilled ſuch ungracious opinions into them, as to take them off from an hearty and diligent anſwer and reply to the Miniſter; and thank themſelves, if ever they be denied the underſtanding the publique worſhip of God. For is there not much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the ſervice ſhould forſake them, who forſake that? And that they who will not concern themſelves reverently and devoutly, as they ought to do, in it; ſhould be made uncapable of ſo doing, by ſuch an invention as this?</p>
                  <p>I know they of the Sectaries (as their writings teſtifie) can be content the Common people ſhould ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> at the laſt: as if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no more than that one word: whereas, in all probability, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not that word at all, in terms; but ſuch a conſtant and general ſuffrage as might be implied in that word; and yet that word very laudably uſed in the concluſion of ſeveral prayers. It may (I ſhould think) put them to the bluſh, to conſider how, herein, they vary from the whole practice of ancient Churches; as I could particularly ſhow, and give us no reaſon why they preſume ſo ſacrilegiouſly to defraud the People. I have, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, met in ſome of their writings, ſuch an one as can ſcarce be wondred at enough, coming from them. For they ſay, it may give ſome occaſion<note place="margin">Account of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at, &amp;c.</note> to the Laity to invade the Office of the Miniſter, (Prieſt they would have ſaid, if they dar'd) to ſpeak ſo in Publique. And is not this wonderful and ridiculous both, that they, who have by their own Principles, quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ancient Hierarchy of the Church, ſo far as power would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them; and by their practice, opened a way for all comers into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, by defending <hi>Extraordinarineſs</hi> of Vocation, ſhould be more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than any Hierarchical perſons in either Ancient or Modern days, for the Dues and Rights of the Miniſtry? This ſurely can have no good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it hath no good reaſon: ſeeing all that the Laity doth in ſuch caſes, is only to follow, and not to lead, as Paſtours do; and to anſwer the call of others, and not to give any law, or word to any. Is there any fear that the common people ſhould aſcend to the throne, when they give their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation by ſhout and applauſe to the Oration of their King made from thence? There ciprocation of the people was never looked upon other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

And as there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before theſe prevaricating Sectaries, any fear that the Deacon ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Prieſts office, becauſe he made anſwer to him; ſo neither, that the people ſhould uſurp either, becauſe they replyed to both, as innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may prove: take this amongſt many which I could add to them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready collected by <hi>Vicecomes.</hi> In the Aethiopian Maſs, which bears the name of<note place="margin">Joſeph.

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the Circumſtances of Divine Worſhip, and firſt of the proper Place of Divine Worſhip, called the Church, the manner of worſhipping there. Of the Dedication of Churches to God: their Conſecration, and the Effects of the ſame. That no man can convert any part of the Church to his private uſe without profanation of it and Sacriledge. Againſt the abuſe of Churches in the Burial of dead Bodies, erecting Tombs, and encloſing them in Churches or Chancels. Rich men have no more right to any part of the Church than the Poor. The Common Law can give no Right in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THERE are two very conſiderable circumſtances in moſt Moral and Divine Actions, <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> which have great influence upon the goodneſs and evil of an action. And we have already ſo far touched the former, as to aſſert the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of a Place Publick above the Private Cloſet, or Domeſtick Rooms. Now it is requiſite we ſhould enquire into the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch publick places, as we call <hi>Temples</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> omitting here<note place="margin">Sic ergo appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamus Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Baſilicam quâ continetur populus, &amp;c. <hi>Aug.

                     </note> the various names and ſignifications and acceptations, as more proper for larger and learneder Treatiſes. And yet we muſt not omit the diſtinction of Church, into Proper and Improper, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth thus uſe it. <hi>For ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we call the Temple</hi> [Baſilica] <hi>the Church, wherein is contained the people, which are truly called the Church; as that by the name Church, that is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The place is called Gods Temple or Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the company and congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods people (which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the Church) doth there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on the days appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Homil. Ch. of Engl. Of the place, &amp;c. p.</hi> 126.</note> 
                     <hi>the people contained in the Church, we ſhould ſignifie the place which contains,</hi> &amp;c. And to prevent all miſtakes, we confeſs we here mean that opprobriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, <hi>The Steeple-houſe,</hi> as no bodies houſe; but, as we believe, the <hi>Houſe of God</hi> by inſtitution and deſignation: however it proves many times by Hereticks and Schiſmaticks intruſion and uſurpation, the Houſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to God: But the Kings Palace is ſtill the Kings, though Rebels and Uſurpers poſſeſs themſelves by violence and injuſtice of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And that certain Houſes may become the houſes of God, in a peculiar manner, no leſs than Houſes and Lands may be the rights of Man, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the very ſame grounds, which are generally three, <hi>Donation, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, Occupation. Donation</hi> is the Transferring of the Right of one Man to another, under which we reduce <hi>Inheritance:</hi> which though now cuſtom of Law has made to deſcend to the next heir, without any act of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55232:231"/>
yet originally it was conſtantly by gift: and the Law ſuppoſes now a gift of the deceaſed, where no formal donation is mentioned to him that is to ſucceed, nor any other. Purchaſe is the transferring of the Right or Dominion one hath of any thing to another, upon civil contract and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; whereas the other ſeemed rather to be natural. Occupation is the poſſeſſion of a thing free from any proprietary, and retaining the ſame unto his own proper uſe. All theſe ways, both Houſes and Lands may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto God, upon this farther ſuppoſition, that to the acquiring of a Right of Dominion, the act of the perſon to whom it is transferred, is not immediately neceſſary, but another in his name and right may aſſume it. So that if any entring into uninhabited and unpoſſeſſed Countries, to which no man layeth a claim, ſhall take up ſuch a quantity of ground in Gods name, and declare it devoted to the uſe of Religion and the Service of God, it as undoubtedly becomes the poſſeſſions of God, as it would have belonged to himſelf, had he retained to himſelf the right of the firſt <hi>Occupant,</hi> as they call it. Again, when out of the revenues of ſuch ſacred Eſtate, commonly called <hi>Church-Lands</hi> or <hi>Means,</hi> there is purchaſe made to the ſame end, and in the ſame nature. But moſt known is that of Free <hi>Donation,</hi> either of one or more to the Service and Honour of God, which we call <hi>Dedication.</hi> Which <hi>Dedication</hi> is an outward act or ceremony ſignifying the <hi>Alienation</hi> of the right formerly poſited in others, and <hi>Tranſlation</hi> thereof to Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: which becauſe, God converſing not with us Civilly, as we do one with another, it cannot be put immediately into the hands of God, is taken up in Gods name for his uſe, by his more immediate Servants: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, is not to be wreſted from him, nor alienated to any prophane, I mean common humane uſes; any more than is that which in right belongs unto one man, to be granted to, or uſurped by another, without conceſſion or conſent in ſome manner implyed, if not expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>This ancient Rite of Dedicating Churches was at firſt very agreeable to the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Religion it ſelf; yet like all paſſing of Eſtates from one to another in the more natural and rude condition of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, where there was alwayes a change of the Propriety, where was any propriety at all; but very ſimple and rude without any formalities as are now in uſe in thoſe called civilized Countries, but with no leſs validity. And ſo it was at firſt in the alienation of Houſes from humane Proprietaries, and devoting them to God. For as <hi>Baronius</hi> hath obſerved, As the Kings<note place="margin">Baron. Ann. 112. num. 45, 46.</note> or Emperours Exchequer was wont at firſt to lay claim to any thing by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting over it the Emperours Mantle, or putting his Image or Name upon it, even ſo the Biſhops were wont to conſecrate Churches to God, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by marking them with the <hi>Title</hi> of the Croſs, or with its Banner. Whence it was that the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius, Leg. ult. de Paganis Cod. Theod.</hi> commanded that the Temples of the Gentiles ſhould ſerve for Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by placing upon them the ſign of the <hi>Venerable Croſs.</hi> Hence is that of <hi>Perkins</hi> concerning this matter, who ſaith, <hi>The ancient Conſecration of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perkins De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem.</note> 
                     <hi>Churches was with meer words and prayers, not with croſſings, or ſuch like rites: And dedication of Churches began about the year 300 after Chriſt,</hi> is partly found true, and partly erroneous. For <hi>Funcius</hi> yields much more, confeſſing<note place="margin">Funcius Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. l. 2. ad Ann. 141.</note> that <hi>Hyginus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ordained that Temples ſhould be dedicated to God with ſolemn Rites and Ceremonies, which was about the year 141. And yet it is true what <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, that very ſimple was the firſt form.</p>
                  <p>But we do not ſo much here enquire into the Antiquity or Form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as the reaſonableneſs and effect of ſuch conſecration. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55232:231"/>
doth appear from the common grounds already laid, and the neceſſity of ſome outward viſible form to be uſed in ſuch Dedications, as well to manifeſt to the world the renunciation of propriety, in any that may otherwiſe pretend to reſerve their right to themſelves, anciently enjoyed, as alſo to declare to what end, and upon what conditions they ſo part with that right, and to whom it thenceforward belongs: all which, if it muſt be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with the opprobrious name of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> &amp; ſo paſs as invalid or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I would pray ſuch enemies, as he did thoſe that deſired Ariſtocratical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to ſettle it firſt in their own Families, and then as experience ſhould prompt to them, to commend it to the Publick: Firſt, to take up eſtates upon ſuch ſimple, unceremonial acts, themſelves; and as they find the event, to offer that as the moſt ſimple and ſober way for Gods Houſe to paſs from others hands into Gods: I know the haters of Superſtition, to far greater ſuperſtition, are wont to ſay, It ſuffices that ſuch is the conſent of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that a place ſhould be allotted in convenient manner to Gods Service, and that it is ſufficiently conſecrated (if they dare ſpeak ſuch a bold word) by <hi>concomitancie,</hi> that is, when ſuch acts of Divine worſhip, as their prayers, and ſpecially preaching, are there exerciſed: But this will no ways be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, both becauſe they do the ſame duties in places which they hold no wayes thereby alienated from their common uſes. And this is no more than for a man to lend another his houſe to keep a Feaſt in it; and not ſo much as if a man ſhould let out his houſe for one to keep his Shevalry or Majoral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in. But that we require is, that a place ſhould ſo be made over to Gods uſe, that it ſhould be out of all mens power juſtly to reduce it to humane propriety and uſes: And this can only be done, and is done by ſuch acts of publick Dedication as we plead for, and never could hear half a note of ſenſe, reaſon, or religion againſt it; though we hear too great and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian clamours to the contrary, with wonted revilings.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing then this, we paſs to the effect of ſuch Dedications unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, one of which is contained and expreſſed in the formal abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation made of all Civil Right to ſuch a place; and by conſequence, for any man to convert any part of it to his own uſe, is ſacrilegiouſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the ſame. A thing, which I take this occaſion to note againſt the groſs abuſe of Churches, by the Greater ſort; who commonly by building them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves large and ſtately Pews, and incloſing what is every poor Chriſtians Freehold, as well as the richeſt and nobleſt of the pariſh, make it more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to the common Chriſtian than any other part of the Church beſides. For that muſt be kept under lock and key; and if not, yet the greatneſs and power of the perſon who hath laid that out for himſelf, ſuffices to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any ordinary man from making the like uſe of that, as of any other part of the Church, leſt his ſecular hand lye heavier upon him, than the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical power can, or muſt upon him, for ſuch invaſion of every pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners right as well as his; So that what it is not lawful for, or juſt to do to the <hi>Common</hi> for beaſts, or <hi>Town-Green</hi> where he lives, he makes no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all to do to Gods <hi>Peculiar,</hi> and the <hi>Common</hi> to Chriſtians: As if ſo be Churches now-a-dayes were of the ſame nature with new found and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Lands in the <hi>Indies;</hi> every man may have what he can encloſe and fenſe in for himſelf and his friends only. Whereas this ſhould be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by every good Chriſtian that hath the fear of God, as a Chriſtian ought, before his eyes, that the pooreſt perſon that takes collection in the pariſh, hath as much reaſon and right to erect places in the Church to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to poſſeſs themſelves of any part of it, as the rich, but that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55232:232"/>
it is not ſo much in his power. And doth any man think he hath a good <hi>Right,</hi> becauſe he <hi>can</hi> do it? <hi>That we can do</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>which we can</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Idpoſſumus, qued ſure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus.</note> 
                     <hi>lawfully do.</hi> But that we can lawfully do, which the Common Law doth not interdict alwayes. For the Common Law (whether becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns altogether men in their civil capacities and proprieties, ſuch as this is not; or whether it hath not heretofore been ſuch a Dragg to encloſe all it could lay hold on, without conſideration of other Courts Eccleſiaſtical, which were alwayes received in all Chriſtian Commonwealths, but left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to the deciſion of the more peculiar Laws made in behalf of Churches, and Eccleſiaſtical Caſes) hath made no proviſion at all for the ſecuring of the Rights of the Church, or Chriſtians thereunto belonging, I mean in their Capacities properly Eccleſiaſtical: ſo that ſcarce any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can be obtain'd from thence, if a man ſhall ſteal any thing off the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body of the Church it ſelf. And can any man that hath any ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion take ſanctuary or protection from that, in defenſe of his violation of Chriſtians Rights, and think all well done that is not puniſhable by that Law, and lawful that it doth not interdict? For by the ſame reaſon a man may incloſe to himſelf a third part or more of the Church. But they will modeſtly ſay, that were unreaſonable. and I will boldly ſay ſo is the other; and eſpecially where, when the Authours of ſuch Fabricks, making no uſe of them themſelves, ſhall deny the uſe of them to others, caſe ſo requiring. But that which is yet more intolerable, is, That the power and purſe of the Great man (who is alwayes to remember that the pooreſt man in the pariſh hath as much Law and Right on his ſide to ſhut him out, as he hath to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and over-top the poor in his building) ſhould enable and embolden him ſo far as to take a conſiderable part of Gods ſanctuary, and incloſe that from all uſe and acceſs, to lay the bones of his Family in, and wholly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate it from all Divine Services, and dedicate it only to corruption, and with impudent Sacriledge to erect many Monuments and Tombs in a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton they have uſurped to themſelves: which being, as is ſaid, no leſs lawful for any man than for one man, inſtead of Chriſtians, in time, we ſhould have a Church filled with Sepulchres of the dead. And when this is once done, to endeavour a redreſs of ſuch ſacrilegious invaſions of Gods and good Chriſtians Rights, is to expoſe Gods ſervants to, not only the obloquy, power, and miſchief of too potent an Adverſary, but to the dammage of Common Law; which though it can give no right ſo to do, yet will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly defend the wrong-doer, if he can plead cuſtom. But I have often thought, that God in this laſt Age hath done himſelf Juſtice againſt ſuch Families, as have been guilty of ſuch prophane uſurpations, in that he hath ſtirred up a barbarous Sect of Chriſtians of late, and let them juſtly into Churches, like <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> to break to pieces, pull down, and raze the ſcandalous monuments of many Churches erected to the honour of Man, and diſhonour of God.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, all dead Bodies were lookt upon by the Heathens themſelves as unclean, and unworthy to be buried within the walls of their City. <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was the firſt that ſuffered Corps to be interr'd in the City, and that<note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Lycurg. Eutropius Lib. 8. Cicero de Legibus, l. 2.</note> near the Temples in <hi>Lacaedemon,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plutarch.</hi> The firſt of all Roman Emperours (and much more of the inferiour people) that was buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City, was <hi>Trajane</hi> the Emperour; which was prohibited by a Law of the twelve Tables, as <hi>Cicero</hi> witneſſeth. And St. <hi>Vedaſtus</hi> was wont to ſay, That the dead ſhould not be buried within the walls of a City, which was a place for the living, and not for the dead; as <hi>Alcuinus</hi> in his life writes.
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55232:232"/>
And it is certain, no Chriſtians at all were buried in Churches for many hundred years, but certain proper Cemateries or Dormitories were allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe, remote from Churches. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, about the year 867, was thought to be preferred to be buried before the Church doors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nauclere.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Nauclere</hi> writeth, how<note place="margin">Nauclerus Vol. 3. p. 64. ibid. p. 94.</note> that about the year 983, <hi>Otho</hi> the third Emperour was buried at the Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> And when they had brought dead bodies to the Church door, they ſoon preſumed to bring them in; and found a reaſon ſo to do: becauſe the bodies of true Believers, and holy Servants of God were not to be looked on, as unclean or unworthy of ſo ſacred a place, becauſe they had been themſelves Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and were to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited again to their bleſſed ſpirits in heaven. And not only ſo, but the nearer the Altar, always the better: miſtaking that place in the <hi>Apocalypſe, I ſaw under the Altar the ſouls of them that were ſlain for the word of God, and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>for the teſtimony which they held;</hi> collecting from hence, that for Martyrs and holy perſons that was the propereſt place to be buried in. And the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, ſurely miſguided by ſuch a vain perſwaſion, hath decreed it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Conſecration of a Church, that there be the body, or at leaſt ſome Relique of a Saint there poſited. But more reaſonably doth it erre, when it affirmeth that it is <hi>Deſecrated</hi> by the interrment of Hereticks there. But certainly the words in the <hi>Revelation</hi> expreſſing a Viſion, meant no ſuch thing as they are alledged for, but only that in that Viſion, the holy Apoſtle beheld the ſouls of Saints and Martyrs departed, humbled before, or at the foot of the Altar (as the manner was anciently to pray eſpecially at the time<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> of offering) crying aloud, and with great importunity, for juſtice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the Perſecutors of the Church, and Murderers of them for the Teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe ſuch hath been, and I fear ever will be, the corruption of Chriſtian Religion, that he that hath power in his hands, and money good ſtore in his purſe, ſhall be Sainted, ſo far as outward ceremonies and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges can advance him, he that would be at the charge of breaking up of the ground, hath not been denyed, nor dare any that I know (whatever they ought to do) deny him the liberty of being buried in the Church This may be, and muſt be paſſed over, but the affectation or irreligious ambition of building ſtately Seats, and making that which is common to all Chriſtians, peculiar to ſome houſe, ſo as upon no occaſion it muſt be uſed by others, is wicked and ſacrilegious: and much more the taking in of any the leaſt part of Gods ground, as the Church is, to the prophane uſes of making Tombs and Sepulchres, and no other. They are wont to ſay, There is room enough beſides. It may be ſo: for they commonly who thus encloſe or uſurp Gods Land, have thin'd the inhabitants of the place where they live, by illegal encloſures of the Common belonging to the Pariſh, and ſo almoſt diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the place. But what is that to them, more than any body elſe? And why may not any man, upon the ſame reaſon, violently or fraudulently take away certain Acres of Land from him, and ſay in his defenſe, He hath left him enough ſtill? And leaſt ſuch as are Patrons of Churches, and have certain ſuppoſed Prerogatives over the Chancels, above what can be pretended to by the common ſort of people, ſhould conceive they may there do as they pleaſe; they are to know, That in right and conſcience ſuch fore-mention'd practiſes can leaſt of all be done. For as the Founder of the Church, ſo likewiſe the Builders of Chancels (from whence only they can pretend ſuch priviledge) and as the maintainers of it in repair, do at the time of the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55232:233"/>
conſecration conſent to a total alienation of all civil propriety from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they can neither build, nor bury there, nor incommodate the place, more than any other man, for they are only Guardians, and not Owners of that place; upon which they may, and ought to exclude and refuſe all ſuch incommodations of others, as may any way deface, or ſtraiten, or empair the ſame, but they have no more right to do any ſuch things there themſelves, then he that is Truſtee or Guardian to an Orphan, to ſeize upon his eſtate, or any part thereof to his own uſe. And it is only civil cuſtom, which hath given him a peculiar right of burial there, rather then any body elſe. And this may ſeem ſufficient, if not too much, to have ſaid of the Negative force of Dedication of Churches, againſt Uſurpers of Gods and Chriſtians Rights.</p>
                  <p>The poſitive effect, which is a veneration and worſhip therein of God Almighty, doth farther confirm this, and is contained in the end expreſſed, as well as in the form of Dedication uſed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> as the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Jews, whoſe Tabernacle or Temple had nothing of conſtant preaching or inſtruction of the people, but only Prayers and Sacrifices. Afterward their Synagogues (called alſo <hi>Proſeuchae</hi>) for convenience, becauſe<note place="margin">Acts 13. 27.</note> all people could not meet at the Temple, were erected: where, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, the Law was read, and <hi>Moſes</hi> preached every Sabbath day: but they had their ſpecial denomination f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this worſhip being in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place in the Church; was always, and ought to be performed in moſt publique manner, and moſt ſolemn, as to outward appearance, as well as inward affection; to which too many deluded by a groſs and cheap piece of Sophiſtry, would confine Gods worſhip.</p>
                  <p>It is time, we have no direct precept in the New Teſtament, that I can call to mind, enjoyning any particular behaviour at the time of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; nor yet in the Law. And why ſo? were not that very neceſſary, in caſe any outward carriage were neceſſary: Yes truly; if ſo be ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious manner of worſhip could be known to us no other way than by Revelation extraordinary. For Gods word is very ſparing in thoſe things of which we may, by the common light of Nature attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For who is there that knows there is a God, that knoweth not alſo, that he is to be worſhipped? Who is there, that knoweth that God is to be worſhipped, thar knoweth not alſo that he is to worſhipped in the moſt lowly and reverent manner? And that reverence outward is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and various, according to the opinion of ſeveral Countries: and therefore no one general Rule could be made comprehending and obliging all people: but this is laid down to us, that what is accounted in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moſt ſolemn, humble, and reverent, is that which is required of us in the worſhip of God. But ſurely kneeling, bowing the body, uncovering the head, yea and proſtration of the body in convenient time and place, are acts of worſhip, ſuch as were in uſe among the Jews of old, continued by the Apoſtles and ſucceſſors in Faith and Devotion, as innumerable places of Holy Writ, in the Old and New Teſtament, intimate unto us: where

And as for the other; no man ought to uſe ſuch abſurd and ridiculous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in his face, being in publique, as ſhould be apt to give offence, but compoſe his whole man to ſuch gravity and decency, as might become the place wherein he is; which is in every mans power, as it is his part. And 'tis very unreaſonable, and ſomewhat more, that men ſhould abhor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ceremonies of Communion and uniformity from the Church, and yet be more ſuperſtitious in inventing, and introducing private Ceremonies into the Church, and unapproved by it: ſuch as this is. But though all poſtures and geſtures be alike in nature; yet nothing muſt be done in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but what is reputed ſober, modeſt, and grave; as well in reſpect of the perſons aſſembled, as for the place ſake: of which, if we had a due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, it would be ſuperfluous to multiply arguments to extort reverence therein.</p>

in every place,</hi> Mal. 1. 11. which <hi>Paul</hi> expounds 1 Tim. 2. 8. <hi>of pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer offered to God in every place.</hi> Of theſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (which I acknowledge to be the ſenſe of the Prophet) I have already given the true meaning, and ſo anſwered both to this effect: That whatever the Scripture prophetically delivers concerning the diffuſion of Gods worſhip, or the Apoſtle actually declares as come to paſs, comes to no more but that, God ſhould be more purely ſerved under the Goſpel by the Sacrifice of prayer, &amp;c. than he was by the Sacrifice of beaſts to him, and ſuch like: and that the ſervice of God ſhould be as well performed out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in it: and in Chriſtian Temples, in what Country or Angle of the world ſoever they were built, as in that of <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> but that it was ever intended, that he ſhould be as well ſerved in the fields or private houſes, as in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches raiſed for that purpoſe (when neceſſity conſtrained not men otherwiſe) doth not in the leaſt appear. And the ſame anſwer likewiſe we give to the words of Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4. 25. of which we alſo ſpake before: As alſo to that of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5. reproving the affected hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical practiſe of the Phariſees, praying in all publick places, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Then which kind of Devotion no doubt but a Prayer in the Cloſet is much more acceptable to God. But doth it therefore follow, that ſuch a prayer as is ſo acceptable in the cloſet, would not be as acceptable in the Temple, and more too? ſurely nothing of this, which ought to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, is contained in the argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now</hi> (proceeds Mr. <hi>Perkins) the opinion of the Papiſt is otherwiſe.</hi> (It is ſo, and is much truer than the Puritans, and more agreeable to the word of God) <hi>For he thinks, that in the New Teſtament, hallowed Churches are more holy than other places are, or can be; and do make the prayers offered to God in them, more acceptable to him than in any other: and hereupon they teach, that private men muſt pray in Churches, and private prayers muſt be made in Churches, if they will have them heard.</hi> All this they teach indeed, but do they teach this as Papiſts or as Chriſtians?

But let us hear how <hi>Perkins</hi> comes off from the allegations of Papiſts, as he calls them, to the advantage of his Cauſe. <hi>Theſe places</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are abuſed by the Popiſh Church: For there is a great difference between the Temple of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our Churches in the New: That was built by particular commandment from God; ſo were not our Churches. That was a type of the very body and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 9. 11. <hi>and of his myſtical body. Again, the Ark in the Temple was a pledge and ſignification of the Covenant, a ſign of Gods Preſence, a pledge of his mercy, and that by his own appointment: for it was his will there to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his people: but the like cannot be ſhewed of our Churches or Chappels.</hi> And whither tends all this, ſo much as to ſhew that the Jews Religion was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Religion than the Chriſtian? For ſurely, that Religion which hath God neareſt, and moſt of his holy preſence, is better than that which wants it. And if it be ſaid, That this was the outward preſence of God chiefly, and not ſo ſpiritual, and therefore inferiour to the Chriſtian; which is true: Then will I ſay, that notwithſtanding the ſaid inſtances of Gods preſence be not to be found with us in our Churches, yet the more ſpiritual and properly divine is, in a greater degree in our Churches, then that Temple. And therefore, thoſe places of Scripture are not abuſed by Papiſts. 2. It doth no where appear in Scripture that they were commanded to build a Temple to God, as is there ſuppoſed: but when <hi>David</hi> entertained the thoughts of it, and <hi>Solomon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the ſame deſign, they had ſpecial directions how they ſhould build it. 3. There needs no Evangelical precept to enjoyn that, which both by the light of nature (as we have ſeen) and ſuch a Preſident of the Law, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſufficiently to Chriſtians, without a new Revelation. 4. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews was not a proper type of Chriſts body: Chriſt indeed, in the Goſpel, compares his body to a Temple: but every ſimilitude is not to be held a type: for then ſhould every common ſhepheard have been a type of Chriſt, as well as <hi>David:</hi> and the Vine ſhould have been a type of Chriſt, and what not, that bears any ſimilitude unto Chriſt?

And the preſence of God is more eminently, though not ſenſibly, in ours than in them. Nay, that Temple, as the worſhip in it, ſeemed to be a type of our Temples and Religion; as our Temples are a type of Heaven, the <hi>Holy of Holieſt:</hi> As their Sabbath is granted by all to be but a type of our Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, and our Evangelical of the Celeſtial.

                     <hi>and ſome of them hath he made ordinary days.</hi> I make no doubt but here it will be anſwered preſently, That God did this, and appointed ſolemn days and ſeaſons to the Jews, and to them only, <hi>which things,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>are to be done away in Chriſt.</hi> And this is very true, in great part: For thoſe Judaical days were appointed by Gods immediate order, and by his will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain evacuated and revers't at the coming of Chriſt: But then all days in uſe among the Jews were not ſo ordained by God; as the Feaſt of Purim, and the Feaſt of Dedication, but by humane prudence: which when they would diſgrace ſufficiently, and acquit themſelves from, they are wont to call <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions;</hi> as if, becauſe God hath in his Word ſignaliz'd for evil, ſuch humane inventions as were quite contrary to his inſtitution, none other agreeable to his word and ſubſervient to it, were to be patiently endured: St. <hi>Paul</hi> then, when he ſaith, <hi>Which things are done away in Chriſt,</hi> doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly mean the Jewiſhneſs and figurativeneſs of them, and not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the days and times inſtituted to the ſervice of God in Chriſt. God ſuffered, God approved, and, for ought doth appear, accepted well the ſaid Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations of his ſignal mercies and deliverances at the Jews hands, until the coming of Chriſt: when the caſe was wholly altered, as that Service, but not ſo as to all future. For an invincible argument it is to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that one day of the week is ſtill continued to ſerve God in a peculiar manner, notwithſtanding after the ſtrong attempts made, eſpecially of late (and never before later days, either by Eaſtern or Weſtern Chriſtians, or by Reformed or Unreformed) to make the Lords day a Sabbath, and obliging Chriſtians by vertue of the fourth Commandment in the Decalogue, nothing to that end is effected.</p>

                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:55232:235"/>Indeed, if men will tenture and extend Gods word to that extream, as thereby to draw every thing, out of any thing, they may reduce all moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto the Ten Commandments, according to the cuſtom of expounding them, <hi>viz.</hi> That where the Effect is commanded or forbidden, there the Cauſe likewiſe: and where the Outward act, the Inward: and where the <hi>Genus,</hi> there the <hi>Species:</hi> and where the Thing, there the Circumſtances: and where one kind, there all of like kinds are forbidden or commanded; then were there ſome colour for what they ſay of all moral duties to be found in the Decalogue, and ſins interdicted: But there is no more ground for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of this ſo, than any other part of Scriptures: And if there were, this would make Eight of the Ten Commandments ſuperfluous, all ſins and all duties being reducible, at this rate, to thoſe two our Saviour in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel refers to, <hi>viz.</hi> Love of God, and Love of our Neighbours. And ſurely, moſt eſſential to all actions are the circumſtances of time and place, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done by Man in Religion, or out of it, without them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould ſeem ſuperfluous expreſly to enjoyn a time to ſerve God in, and diſtinctly from the act which unavoidably implyes it. And if it be ſaid that not ſo much a time ſimply, as a time preciſely ſo determined, <hi>viz.</hi> to a Seventh Day, and that in ſuch and ſuch manner to be obſerved, is inſtituted of God, then do fall to the ground the ſuppoſed naturalneſs, and morality of the time there commanded: and that by natural light or law, no more is commanded then time, or at moſt a day, but not a Seventh Day. Now if we are, being Chriſtians, under the Law no farther than in theſe two reſpects, Firſt, as ſome of it is repeated and enforced by the Law of the Goſpel, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us by Chriſt; Secondly, as it is conſonant to the Law of Reaſon or Nature: And that a ſeventh part of our time ſhould be dedicated conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God is no where ſo poſitively delivered in the New Teſtament, as it was in the Old: nor doth the light of Nations or Nature ſuggeſt any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time (for that only, and not of time in general, is all the queſtion.) How can a Seventh Day be commanded of God?</p>
                  <p>It is not to be denyed but ſome of the ancient heathen Philoſophers and Poets, did talk of ſomewhat of ſacredneſs in the Seventh Day. But firſt, whence had they ſuch opinions? from the thing it ſelf? No ſurely, it was a ſuperſtitious and blind admiration of the number <hi>Seven,</hi> of which we find ſo much in their writings: and eſpecially the conſideration of the Seven Planets in the Heavens, which made them think better of the Seventh Day; or cauſe the week to conſiſt of ſo many days and no more. But what real opinion they had of that above other days, doth appear in their practiſe,<note place="margin">Philo In Decalog. pag. 585. Id. De Opificio Mundi pag. 15, 16. &amp; 21. Genevae.</note> which no monuments declare to have been in more ſacred or ſolemn eſteem than any other. And the reputed ſacredneſs of the number <hi>ſeven</hi> is that, which <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> playeth upon ſo handſomly in his commendation of the Jewiſh ſeventh day, as may be ſeen in his works.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> from thence takes a better argument to prove that a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is not moral, from whence ſeveral have endeavoured to prove that it is, and that in a more ſacred manner than any other of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For to perſwade to a preciſe obſervation of it, theſe ſay, that God hath ſet a <hi>Memento,</hi> a <hi>Remember</hi> upon it, ſuch as upon no other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore, there ſhould be ſomewhat extraordinary in it. And ſo there is indeed: For, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whereas all other Commandments are very agreeable to the Reaſon of man, and are in ſome degree known to him by natural light, and ſo need not the like intimation and advice, this of a Seventh Day to be kept holy to God, cannot be diſcerned by Natures light
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55232:236"/>
at all, and therefore needeth ſuch a Memento and Remembrancer as this to bring that to his mind which is ſo apt to ſlip out.</p>
                  <p>'Tis granted, moderner Jews, in deſpight of Chriſt and Chriſtians, have aſſerted a naturalneſs and immutability of this Command, and an extent of it to all Nations, but this concludes not Chriſtians, knowing from whence ſuch Antichriſtian Dogmes proceed.</p>
                  <p>Now here lyes the labour, to infer a Seventh Day from the Law, obliging Chriſtians, I ſay, from the letter of the Law, and not from the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing it ſelf, to which they flee, who find their other proofs too weak: and here I will not contend much with them. But all their Old Teſtament teſtimonies being more eaſily evaded and nulled then they are alledged by this one anſwer, That they ſpeak only of Jewiſh Sabbaths, and ſo have no force at all upon us, or the ſame in all reſpects that they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Jews, they muſt be conſtrained to repair only to Goſpel for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of any day ſeparate from civil affairs, and dedicate to God. And here they are altogether to ſeek for any one direct or poſitive Precept: not one in all the New Teſtament can be found for any, either Seventh or Firſt Day of the week. Whereupon they are compelled to betake themſelves to the uncertain way of arguing from Example to a Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe they read ſeveral inſtances in the New Teſtament, of things done on the firſt Day of the week, in reference to Religion and the Service of God, therefore, that day ought ſpecially and religiouſly to be obſerved: they will perhaps ſay, That the infinite bleſſing of our Redemption by Chriſt, and his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is the ground of our obſervation, as the Creation was of theirs: This I grant to be a juſt and ſufficient cauſe: but it doth not from thence follow that therefore actually it was ſo conſtituted upon that ground. We now are in queſt of the Conſtitution it ſelf, and not of the Reaſon why it ſhould be ſo ordained. For many things that ſeem to us very reaſonable, are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly actually ordained. And many things for which in the New Teſtament we may find preſidents of the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical perſons, do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer a Rule or Precept: But in the New Teſtament there is nothing but Examples, and they not peculiar to that day. From whence I would conclude no more than this, That the true ground of dedicating a day to the Service of God, is to be fetch'd from the light of Nature, in which all Nations religious conſent: but the ground of keeping the Seventh Day, as<note place="margin">Chryſ. Homil. 12. pag. 542. Antioch.</note> the Seventh, was meerly Moſaical and Judaical, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo hath well gathered from the reaſon annexed unto it. <hi>For in ſix days the Lord made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and reſted the Seventh day:</hi> whereas (ſaith he) God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us no reaſon why we ſhould not commit Murder or Adultery, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the command is ſo agreeable to nature. Again, the ground of keeping that Seventh Day which we do, is to be taken wholly from Chriſtian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thirdly, the form or manner of obſerving that Day is to be taken from the Preſcriptions of the Apoſtles, ſo far as they ſtand recorded in the New Teſtament, and from Apoſtolical practiſes ſhining ſucceſſively in the following Ages of the Churches: Yet not ſo, as if it were not lawful for this Age of the Church to keep it more ſtrictly and ſacredly than did the very firſt Age of the Church, and ſome following it; and the rather becauſe it is certain, that the Primitive Chriſtians did keep two days Feſtival in one week to the honour of God: the ancient Seventh Day of the Jews, and the newly inſtituted day of the Chriſtians, as might here be made apparent.<note place="margin">Centur. 1. l. 2. cap. 6.</note> But I ſhall here only add the judgment of the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> concerning the firſt Century of years, where they write thus: <hi>Mention is made of the

                  <p>And for the Tranſlation they ſpeak of to be made of the Service of God from the Saturday to the Sunday, they ſpeak altogether without the Book of God, or of the ancient Hiſtorians of the Church. For that had had little of Chriſtianity in it, and could ſerve to no end ſo much as to ſpite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Jews, as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath noted: For it had made indeed both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jews and Chriſtians too: Them, to have the preciſe command of God to them, ſo directly violated: Theſe, to retain the ſame thing which could not conſiſt with Chriſtianity impoſed upon them, with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time only varied. For they who ſpeak of Tranſlation of a thing, cannot mean here the natural day it ſelf tranſlated, or more properly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the Firſt: nor can they mean the worſhip of that day tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this: For that was Judaical and Antichriſtian: And if neither of theſe can be allowed, what mean they to talk of changing, or tranſlating of one day to another? And why do they not ſpeak the truth roundly, and dare to ſay, That Chriſtians inſtituted the Firſt Day of the week in commemoration of the Benefits they received by Chriſt, without any conſideration at all of any command in the Old Teſtament; and that it was a ceſſation of the Jewiſh Sabbath, and an introduction of a Chriſtian, quite of another nature?</p>
                  <p>And that ſo it is, appeareth from the conceſſions made by the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of a Sabbatical Lords Day, which I ſhall here contract, as neceſſary to ſatisfie the Scruples and Doubts bred by careleſs handlers of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>Things temporary in the Sabbath are theſe,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins.

they have drawn an argument for the Morality, and that worthily, could it be proved what they preſume. But others, that have ſifted the matter more<note place="margin">Curcelleus diatrib de Sabbato, c. 6.</note> narrowly and accurately, deliver the contrary for a certain truth, <hi>viz. That the firſt Sabbath obſerved by the Jews in the Deſart, was not reckoned from the beginning of the creation, but from the day in which Manna was firſt rain'd down, as may be ſeen out of</hi> Exod. 16. v. 4, 5, 13. <hi>which two are ſuppoſed to meet together, but upon no good foundation.</hi> But this is certain, that we find a breach of the Sabbath, and ſevere puniſhment executed upon the breakers of it, before the promulgation of the Ten Commandments on Mount <hi>Sinah.</hi> But to this (the beſt argument I find for the Antiquity of it) it is well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the ſame reaſon is for the Antiquity of the Tabernacle too, which moſt certainly was not made till a long time after the firſt mention we have of it. For <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to take the Tabernacle, and pitch it without the Camp, whenas the hiſtory following relateth the particular materials, and form, and ſolemn erection of it to be a good while after.

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the Inſtitution of the Lords Day. That it was in part of Apoſtolical and partly Eccleſiaſtical Tradition: Feſtival Days and Faſting derived unto us from the ſame Fountain, and accordingly to be obſerved upon the like grounds. Private Prayers in Families, to the neglect of the Publique Worſhip, unacceptable to God. Of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation all Prieſts have to pray daily accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Office. Of the Abuſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days in the Number, and unjuſtifiable occaſions of them. Of the Seven Hours of Prayer, approved by the Ancient Church, and our Firſt Reformers. Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi>'s Cavils against Canonical Hours refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THAT the Inſtitution of the Lords day, hath no known foundation from the Command of God or Chriſt, may be collected from what is ſaid. But that the Apoſtles, and Church Apoſtolical, did by their example and practice commend it to following ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of Chriſtians, I acknowledge moſt true. But ſtill there remains a knot to be untied about the force of that Conſtitution, whether it was only of Cuſtom or Precept; or all the Obligation proceeded from the decrees of the Church after the Apoſtles. For direct Precept we find little or no Grounds in Scripture. For Practice Apoſtolical, and Cuſtom upon that deſcending to poſterity, alſo the acceſſion of the Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Imperial, we make no ſcruple to acknowledge them to be very ſolemn and obligatory upon all good Chriſtians. But ſeeing all things practis'd by the Apoſtles are not Obligatory, it will be worth the enquiry, under what Capacity they ſo acted; whether as Apoſtles, or as Governors of the Church in ſuch a large ſenſe as might be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to their ſucceſſours. That it was not meerly and preciſely an Apoſtolical Act to eſtabliſh ſuch a Feſtival, ſeems to appear from the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55232:238"/>
grounds found in the Law of Nature moving men to celebrate a day to God; again, that the firſt day of the week, being the day of our Lord and Saviours Reſurrection, ſeems to be no other than Common Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Prudence, as that which agreeth moſt with the End it ſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> The due commemoration of Chriſts reſurrection on that day: but that Chriſt ſhould be ſo Commemorated, and God ſo glorified, ſeems to me to be ſpecially Apoſtolical, and ſo Divine, that it is not alterable by the Counſel or Decrees of the Church any time after: from whence may conveniently be reconciled the oppoſite opinions of both School-men and Canoniſts; ſome of whom have aſſerted the divine Right of the Lords day, and others the Eccleſiaſtical or Canonical only. For that a day be Feſtivally obſerved to God, is Natural; that on ſuch a Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or Thankſgiving day, Chriſt ſhould be magnified and God praiſed, is Apoſtolical: but that on the <hi>Firſt</hi> day of the week, Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the neceſſary power of the Church may ſeem to ſuffice. Which appeareth from the manner of celebrating the Chriſtian Sabbath, which hath been always left to the Authority and wiſdom of the Church, varying according to occaſions given. For that Chriſtians very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently met to treat of divine matters, to communicate, to celebrate the Euchariſt, and to ſing Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, <hi>Juſtine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Juſtin. Apol. 2. Tertul. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger.</note> 
                     <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the famous Epiſtle of <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſs. And to this end they had a vacation from all worldly ſervile matters, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs of Antiquity demonſtrate. And for the dignity of this day it was, that on it, and none other, Biſhops were to be conſecrated by the conſtitution of <hi>Leo</hi> 1. And what are the Prerogatives of this Firſt<note place="margin">Leo 1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. 75. c. 1. Quod die, &amp;c.</note> day of the week, are explained at large by the Ancient Fathers and Councils here not to be rehearſed.</p>
                  <p>From this Fountain of Eccleſiaſtical power reſident in the Church, ſpringeth the Act of inſtituting other days to the Glory and Praiſe of God, of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> days of Humiliation; and Exultation, or joy. For it is certain, that, after it was agreed upon that Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be weekly celebrated, it was conſented to alſo, that a Yearly Thankſgiving ſhould be kept for the ſame, which was the Chriſtians Paſſover; and our Eaſter day is immemorially practiſed, and without interruption derived to this preſent age. And therefore as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the greateſt matter of joy that at any time befell the Church of Chriſt; as becauſe it regulateth other principal Feaſts and Faſts of the Church; as laſtly, becauſe thence is plainly inferred a power in the Church of ordaining Feaſts, and Faſts to the worſhip of God, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Ancient, <hi>The Mother of Feaſts.</hi> And ſurely upon this, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church produced many other <hi>Daughter-Feaſts,</hi> not all in a year, nor an age: but according to their power to maintain and defend them; which was very difficult for them to do as becomed, under Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile perſecution: who were moſt ſevere againſt ſuch Celebrities inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſtians to the overthrow and contempt of Gentile worſhip, which according to the Light of nature conſiſted much in this: as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55232:238"/>
whereby all the natural and Civil benefit of Vacation from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, friendly converſation, and ſuch like might be enjoyed; and due worſhip and praiſe be given unto God in Chriſt Jeſus. And therefore,<note place="margin">Theodoret. Serm. 7. de Sacrificiis.</note>

Conſcience likewiſe binds to faithful obedience to our Eccleſiaſtical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, in ſuch pious exerciſes as theſe, and againſt which no more then the rude Effects of their private opinions, and paſſion hath been alledged: notwithſtanding, I know how much <hi>Gelaſpie,</hi> and after

                  <p>And for the ſame reaſon, I reduce what may be ſaid about Faſts, to what is already ſaid of the Feaſts of the Church. For there is the very ſame reaſon of Antiquity Apoſtolical, for the obſervation of both power and Liberty of the Church, juſt occaſions offered; Conformity to the Primitive ſtate of the Church; Advantages of ſuch exerciſes; Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſticks of Chriſtian, from unchriſtian ſocieties and profeſſions; which all equally infer the duty of Faſting on ſet days, as of Feaſting; and the madneſs and wickedneſs of ſuch Chriſtians, as dare open their mouths againſt them; becauſe no doubt but both one and other have been much abuſed by Roman ſuperſtition. Yet not Faſting ſo much as Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val days. The abuſes may here be noted to be theſe. 1. Multitude, whereby works of Nature and Civil neceſſities ſhould be ſo far impeded<note place="margin">Origen. Hom. 10. in Geneſ.</note> and retarded, that no ſmall prejudice ſhould befall the Common-wealth thereby. Indeed <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every day is to be a Feſtival to a Chriſtian,</hi> calling them Jews who obſerve ſome now and then: but his meaning is not, that every day a man ſhould ceaſe from his labour wholly, and only wear his beſt cloaths, walk about, and do nothing but worſhip God; but, as there he expreſſes himſelf, ſhould go to Church daily, and not content himſelf with his domeſtique devotion, but appear before God in publique place, though not in that publique manner, as with the aſſembly of Chriſtians. This ſtill binds, as a Councill at leaſt, if not Command; and that which, as hath been ſhewed already, is much better, then that which is performed within the walls of our<note place="margin">Bucerus de Regno Chriſt. lib. 2. cap. 10.</note> own houſe or Cloſets, if we will take <hi>Bucers</hi> judgment, who ſpeaketh thus. <hi>When as all that we have, and are, and our very lives, we have received, and do receive daily from the free bounty of God: is it not very meet alſo that we ſhould aſſemble daily alſo to render him thanks, and to renew our devotion to him, and our worſhip of him, by his Word and Sacraments, which he hath for this purpoſe appointed for us, and by daily Prayers which he requireth of us? Your Majeſties therefore (he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth) Part it is to inforce the authority of the Divine Law, againſt this ſo great abuſe of God, and unbridled profanation of Holy days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, if Sectaries Religion be examined duly, which hath procured them ſo much credit and eſteem, amongſt unknowing people, it will be found to fall ſhort by much, of that which is approved and eſtabliſhed by our Church. They are ſaid to be frequent, and conſtant in duties (as they call them) of their Families, meaning prayers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps morning and evening: this is very good and laudable. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider we a little whence this practice hath ariſen, whither it tendeth, and it is rather a defrauding God of that due which we plead for, then out-doing others. The Church, the publique houſe of God, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of Gods worſhip, and that he is more glorified in, than by home-made worſhip. Therefore for them to tranſlate the Service of God out of the Church at all times, but when a Sermon calls them forth, into their own houſes, and to offer the morning and evening ſacrifice at home, when it ought, and may be offered in his own houſe, is ſo far from deſerving the name of extraordinary Pieties, that it deſerves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55232:239"/>
the name of Sacriledge. And this I ſpeak meaning, when this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from that brutiſh opinion, that all places are alike to God, (which is only true, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> and not <hi>Compoſito,</hi> viz. before ſome one place be determined, and dedicated eſpecially to his worſhip, and not after) or from the contempt of Gods houſe, or from diſlike of the Publique worſhip, or from admiration of our own Gifts and a delight to ſhow them; or laſtly, a deſign to breed a faction in private, againſt the publique profeſſion. I know likewiſe, and grant, that ſeveral juſt Impediments there are to the publique ſervice; and in ſuch Caſes, moſt neceſſary it is, that Gods ſervice ſhould be performed within doors: But it is not neceſſary that this ſhould be performed (as the affected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) in a ſervice quite diſtinct from the publique, yea often quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What men ſpeak in prayer and ſpiritual devotion between God and their own ſouls privately, they are the only proper judges of, and Chriſtian, not Liberty only, but piety requires they ſhould ſo be. But ſurely, when Men ſpeak before others, as well as God, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as the Place, which diverſifies the worſhip in a Family from that in the Church, that of the Church is moſt proper: And not to ſay any thing of the Laity, no Prieſt or Miniſter of our Church ought, upon common occaſions, to officiate in Prayers in Private Families, any otherwiſe than he is bound to do in Publique: eſpecially if they to whom he officiates, and himſelf, have not performed their duties in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before in Publique; which when they have, then only is the proper place for another free-will offering unpreſcribed.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here inſiſt on the obligation all Prieſts have to recite their Office, as I could; but only give this general reaſon, That every Prieſt is ordained of God by man, as a conſtant interceſſour between God and Man in behalf of the People, and eſpecially them, of whom he hath a Paſtoral charge; and not only the nature of his Office, but condition of his Benefice requires that this he doth conſtantly or daily twice: the old rule being very reaſonable, <hi>viz. Beneficium requirit officium;</hi> the temporal benefits received by the Clergy, require ſpiritual office. The firſt is daily and ſo ſhould the ſecond alſo be. And this is no ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as the contrary, that the Prieſt ſhould have nothing to do but when he preaches; or that he ſhould pray and offer to God as liketh beſt every ſingle Chriſtian, which is impoſſible and ridiculous; and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable preſumption in any man to preſcribe to their Miniſter how he ſhould miniſter to them, when he is lawfully preſcribed his duty before: and if he were not, he ought to preſcribe to others, not of the ſame order with himſelf, and not take Laws from them: which is the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moderneſt of all Innovations. But the Recitation of the Office by the Prieſt, is a conſtitution of above a thouſand years ſtanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Barthol.

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55232:240"/>
in all the true ſons of the Church to be preſent at them, and to joyn with the Prieſt. Which becauſe it cannot be expected that all men well inclin'd, ſhould be always in a capacity to do, the Prieſt doubtleſs may comply with the exigencies of others, ſo it be not to the pre judice of the Publique: And now conſidering alſo the many extraordinary days of Feſtivals, and ordinary days of Faſting, wherein eſpecial obligation lies upon all Good Chriſtians, ſo far as they can, without juſtifiable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, to appear in the houſe of God, and worſhip him, (not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their perſonal and private devotions at home) and comparing the ſame with the practice of Puritans, who are ſo ſtrangely deluded with the great vertue of a Sermon, and extemporary prayers at home, that it goes quite againſt the hair, if not conſcience of them, to viſit Gods houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of prayers and adoration only; let it be fairly judged, whether they have ſuch cauſe to inſult over our Religion; and not be aſhamed of their groſs defects, and diſſonancy from all that ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtianity before their days. Will their bold pretences to Giftedneſs (think they) in their rare way of worſhip, cover theſe foul blemiſhes from God, when they do not from men?

Truly and learnedly ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi> upon <hi>Matthew: The Age of</hi> Hieromne <hi>knew very few Feaſts except the Lords day.</hi> And in another place he writes thus. <hi>With the Jews ſome days were prophane, and ſome days holy, but with the Chriſtians every day is equally</hi> (this he ſpeaks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of <hi>Origen,</hi> not excepting the Lords day) <hi>holy; Not that Feſtivals are not to be obſerved, which the holy Fathers inſtituted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the more commodious aſſembling of Chriſtian People, and to the worſhip of God; but that they were very few, to wit, The Lords day, Eaſter, and Pentecoſt, and ſome ſuch like reckoned up by</hi> Hieromne. <hi>But I know not whether it be expedient to add Feaſt upon Feaſt, eſpecially ſince we ſee the manners of Chriſtians to come to that paſs, that ſo much reaſon as there was of old, to inſtitute them for pieties ſake, ſo great ſeems there to be to antiquitate them.</hi> Thus he. And this hath been the opinion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the courſe taken in the Reforming the abuſe in the number of them.</p>
                  <p>And a ſecond abuſe hath been pared off by us, ſeen in the end of them, which is rather to the honour of Saints, than of God or Chriſt, among Papiſts. I know at the long run, as we may ſo ſpeak, they aſcribe in their doctrine all to God, but not half of them have this ſenſe, and little or nothing many times comes from them, but what is directed to the Saint they then worſhip.

murther'd upon the high-way, and that for none of his vertues: but for ſticking cloſſer to the uſurping Pope, than to Chriſt or his Prince; to whom he was a much greater Rebel than was <hi>Cranmere,</hi> which a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late impudent railer hath in print ſo termed, to diſgrace him and the Reformation ſo far as naked lies can prevail, without the leaſt inſtance, againſt which of thoſe Princes he lived under, or in what he died an impenitent Traitor, as he calls him. This we know, the Hall of the Jeſuites Seminary in <hi>Rome,</hi> is hung round almoſt with ſuch Saints as have died convicted of treaſon againſt their Prince and Country, as Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as ever any were, But no more of this.</p>
                  <p>There yet remains ſomewhat to be ſaid under this head, of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons</hi> of Prayer, and that is concerning Hours of Prayers, called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical:</hi> which were retained and publiſhed by our Church, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation, by the confeſſion of that unſatisfied and unquiet Puritan Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> himſelf, who wrote againſt them, and the<note place="margin">Prinne againſt Conſens. pag. 32.</note> excellent deſign of the Reverend Publiſher of them, with great wrath and bitterneſs, and all the reaſon he could, which was little enough, God knows. <hi>In the year</hi> (ſaith he) 1560 <hi>was printed Orarium, or a Book of Prayers, which mentioned Canonical Hours. But in the ſecond impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the year 1564; theſe hours were quite obliterated: and ſo in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> 1573. But if theſe things be ſo, the Firſt Edition is with me much more Authentique than the following; unleſs it can be proved, that ſuch alterations were made with the like authority with the firſt. For we have divers inſtances of Puritans buſie zeal to make alterations in impreſſions of ſuch books as offend their corrupt humor, and that upon their private heads; watching Preſſes that print any thing that troubles them, and purging them. Hath not the late Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> in his<note place="margin">Lauds ſpeech in the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. An. 1637. pag. 64, 65, 66, 67, &amp;c.</note> ſolid and judicious refutations of their contumelies and ſcurrilous ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt their Governors, found out their falſeneſs, in contriving the expunging of that clauſe in the twentieth of the nine and thirtieth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> viz. <hi>The Church hath power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and authority in matters of Faith.</hi> And having cauſed the Article with this raſure, to be printed, to argue from that Copy, and flie moſt boldly in the faces of the Prelates, as forgers of Articles in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Editions; when there were ſo many ancienter Copies retaining that Clauſe; as that of the year 1593 and 1563 and 1605: and in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Records of them: And having ſo done, to ſay, the Article was never ſo printed before the year 1628: But the reaſon there given makes the matter more clear. For many ſcrupling ſuch Right in the Church, refuſed to ſwear to the Articles ſo framed: and thereupon made no ſcruple to purge them of ſuch troubleſom matter; and having ſo done, to cover their wickedneſs the better, to begin to clamour loudly againſt the Biſhops, as if in their Edition they had foiſted (as they ſpeak) that into them, of their private heads. And what can be a greater, or more bold preſumption in them to attempt, than in the Title of the Singing Pſalms, which never had the leaſt approbation of either Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Authority, to print theſe words, <hi>Set forth and allowed to be ſung in all Churches of all the people together, before and after Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening prayer, and alſo,</hi> &amp;c? whereas they could never yet produce the leaſt colour of Authority more than groſs connivance at that will-worſhip of their own heads: For the Church never owned any other Pſalms or Singing, but what ſhe warranted by her practice
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55232:241"/>
in Cathedrals, which, as it was much more ancient and ſolemn, ſo much more eaſie alſo for common people to learn, and more eaſie to be underſtood by thoſe who are not able to joyn with them that ſo ſing. And yet (what will not affectation of mens own invention, and ſpite againſt others drive men to ſay?) they boldly argue againſt that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſinging, as not eaſily intelligible or to be learnt; and alſo as a way moſt unfit to addreſs ones ſelf to a Prince in, and much more to God; as if their contrived Pſalming of it, were not much more obnoxious to theſe exceptions, and more ridiculous to be uſed towards any man, than the other: The only advantage theſe have above the Churches grave, plain, and chearful way of Reciting the Pſalms, being that they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into this their own way, but cannot tell how, or why, and admire it infinitely.</p>
                  <p>But to return: Can we, knowing they have been guilty of ſuch vile Artifices, make any great ſcruple to think that they might play falſe with the ſaid <hi>Orarium</hi> too, of which Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> ſpeaks? Such doings, and the diſuſe of theſe, might give occaſion to the Rhemiſts in their Comments to affirm, that, <hi>The Church of England hath utterly rejected Canonical Hours of Prayers.</hi> Which is not ſo. Indeed ſhe doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them with that rigour, as doth the Roman Church, but commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame as very godly and profitable. And there is not one book in more eſteem with her, next to the Office of the Liturgy it ſelf, than that book, to that end publiſhed by the late Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Coſens:</hi> notwithſtanding all the dirt caſt in the face of it and him, by Mr. <hi>Prinne:</hi> And notwithſtanding the three notable abuſes noted amongſt the Papiſts, by Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> in the uſe of the Canonical Hours; <hi>First,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perkins Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, p. 79.</note> 
                     <hi>in binding to them upon mortal ſin;</hi> This we acknowledge to be an abuſe, unleſs the perſons have brought themſelves under any Rule or Order which requires ſuch ſervices, (as ſuch may lawfully be) and wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſame: <hi>Secondly, binding only to thoſe hours, whereas thoſe hours differ not from others;</hi> But here we are to diſtinguiſh; firſt, between binding to thoſe hours only, as if it were not permitted to uſe them at any other hours, which I know none do: and not binding them to any others, but them only; this is lawful. <hi>secondly,</hi> between binding to hours for the Hours ſakes, and for Orders ſake. Indeed Hours (as is ſolidly and very philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically argued) differ not in nature one from another: But emergencies and occaſions may diverſifie them, and the devotions belonging to them, without any juſt objection to be made to the contrary: A Third abuſe noted by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> is, <hi>That a man may ſay the Canonical hours of one day for another;</hi> which may be an abuſe, or no abuſe, as the matter is ordered. To neglect wilfully ones uſual prayers, is certainly ill: but having ſo done, to double his prayers the next day, is no ſuch error as may be ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Much beſides this may be ſaid out of the Authority of the Church, and more out of Scripture, than may be found for ſome things by Puritans religiouſly obſerved: Much likewiſe is here wont to be ſaid about the Hours themſelves, the reaſon, and number of them: but I cut off all them at preſent, and reſolve all into the general reaſonableneſs and piety of ſuch a practice; and the manifold benefit which may accrue unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and devout uſer of them, though he ties not himſelf to any one form ſtrictly: and ſo ſhall reſt, till I can hear what can be objected worthy of a Chriſtian againſt them, more than I have found already, which may be as well objected againſt Morning and Evening prayer, as them.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p> The Third thing to be conſidered in the Worſhip of God, <hi>viz.</hi> The true Object, which is God only. That it is Idolatry to miſapply this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip. What is Divine Worſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called. Of the multitude and miſchiefs of New diſtinctions of Worſhip. <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> though diſtinct, of no uſe in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. What is an Idol. <hi>Origen</hi>'s criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme of an Idol, vainly reſted on. What an Image. What Idolatry. The diſtinction of Formal and Material Idolatry, upon divers reaſons rejected. The Papiſts really Idolatrous, notwithſtanding their good Intentions pretended. Intention and Reſolution to worſhip the true God, excuſe not from Idolatry. <hi>Spalato, Forbes,</hi> and others, excuſing the Romaniſts from thence, diſproved. That Idolatry is not always joyned with Polytheiſm, or worſhipping more Gods than one. How the Roman Church may be a true Church, and yet Idolatrous.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRom the nature, kinds, acts, circumſtances of Place and Times of Prayer, we paſs to the object of this worſhip of Invocation and Adoration: which is the moſt important of all; and which, as duly obſerved, is the end, complement and perfection of all Religion; ſo miſtaken, is the fouleſt of all errors, and the higheſt of all provocations and affronts of almighty God; who<note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 8.</note> proteſteth by his Prophet, upon this occaſion, <hi>I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give unto another, neither my praiſe unto gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images.</hi> This therefore it were ſuperfluous to prove, which all Chriſtians, yea almoſt all the world, as well Unchriſtian, as Chriſtian, doth readily and unanimouſly aſſent to, That God only is the proper object of Divine or Religious worſhip. And they that glory that they ſtick firmly to this, what do they more than do Infidels and Heathens, who all hold that God is to be worſhipped, with ſupreameſt worſhip,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55232:242"/>
and that Idolatry is a notorious errour and offence againſt him? This I ſay, all rational men aſſent to in the notion; that the worſhip of the true God, or which ſeems to be the very ſame, the true worſhip of God, is to be given only to God; and yet fall flat into the Practice of that great ſin.</p>
                  <p>For though Idolatry be ſo odious in its name, yet in its nature it is very pleaſing and raviſhing of our ſenſes; and hath of late days been ſo fairly and neatly trimmed up, by the fine wits and curious hands of men, and they eſpecially Chriſtians, and they more eſpecially Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques (God bleſs us) that now there is either no ſuch thing to be found in the world, or that, the leaſt ſin, one of them, in the world. And this is brought about by the miniſtry, and help of innumerable diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; which I think may be reduced to theſe two heads: <hi>viz.</hi> to thoſe concerning the Act of worſhipping, and thoſe concerning the Object of worſhip. Concerning the Act, we find ſuch as theſe very common and current; firſt, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Religious:</hi> And theſe again <hi>Properly Divine,</hi> or <hi>Improperly; supream</hi> and <hi>Inferior; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> and <hi>Indirect; Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Relative; Ultimate</hi> and <hi>subalternate</hi> or <hi>subordinate; Mediate</hi> and <hi>Immediate: For its own ſake</hi> or <hi>for anothers ſake.</hi> Again, for its own ſake, which we worſhip, as a thing in it ſelf, or as a Repreſentation of another: All theſe, (but theſe are not all) to be found in Learned Authors books, to rectifie the worlds errours in its Religion. And beſides theſe, more may be found concerning the Object, but this one ſhall I only name, which is their ſtrongeſt Hold and Refuge. That, to ſecure them from all aſſauls of Adverſaries; this, to receive them when they ſhall by ſtrong hand at any time be beaten out of their faſtneſſes: And that is that modern, but very famous diſtinction of <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal.</hi> So that ſome of no mean knowledge, have thus defended themſelves: What if (for inſtance in the Maſs) we ſhould by errour worſhip that as God, which is not God? yet this would be but Material Idolatry, at the moſt, and not Formal: ſeeing we believe that to be very God, which we ſo adore: and Material Idolatry (with ſuch circumſtances) we muſt ſuppoſe, is one of the leaſt ſins that we can be ſubject to. Thus have ſome diſcourſed to me, though 'tis well known, ſome others of them, as <hi>Coſterus,</hi> do acknowledge, that if<note place="margin">Coſterus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid.</note> Catholicks miſs their mark, and that be not really God, which they with divine worſhip adore in the Sacrament, they are groſs Idolaters. Of this we ſhall ſpeak more by and by. Now are we to conſider firſt, of the firſt ſort of diſtinctions; to paſs over all which, by a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, would be too tedious a task for my ſelf, and Reader too: I ſhall therefore only examine the moſt reaſonable, and comprehenſive of them: and them I take to be that of Worſhip Civil and Divine; and of Abſolute and Relative: not omitting altogether others.</p>
                  <p>And to underſtand clearly what is meant by Divine Worſhip, we are to enquire, whether the Act makes the Worſhip, or the Object; For all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as other Acts moral, takes it ſpecification from the Object, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay; then, unleſs the Object be Divine, or God himſelf, cannot the Worſhip be Divine; and ſo by conſequence a man cannot give Divine Worſhip, though he would never ſo fain, unto an object not Divine: and ſo cannot, though he would, commit Idolatry; becauſe the worſhip it ſelf is not Divine, but much inferior: becauſe the object is ſuch, which conſtitutes not Divine Worſhip, being ſome Creature. But
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55232:242"/>
if the Act in its own nature be intrinſecally Divine, it would be known, what is that which makes it ſo. For they ſay, all acts external are equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and dubious in themſelves; and indifferent to Civil, Religious, Inſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or Supream worſhip: and that nothing can be concluded from thence Idolatrous. For we bow the head, we bend the knee, we fall down at the feet of men many times, whom we give no Idolatrous worſhip unto, nor are charged by any underſtanding reaſonable perſon ſo to do. And what they affirm of all outward Reverence or Worſhip, I ſee no reaſon but may be ſaid of all inward Adoration too, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is Equivocal and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to Divine and Human Reverence; unleſs it be determined and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificated by ſomewhat beſides it ſelf. For <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> may be, and that inwardly, exhibited to the Creature, and the degrees of all theſe may be greater and more intenſe towards our Prince, whom we ſo reverence, humble our ſelves before, and Petition; than when in this manner we addreſs our ſelves to God, and yet this not reputed Idolatrous worſhip: Yea we openly profeſs, we humbly, earneſtly, and with all our hearts, deſire ſuch a thing from man, and ſo I doubt not but many do with greater affection and inward ſenſe than they generally ſeek to God, and yet no man charges them with Idolatry. So that the inward acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are equivocal no leſs than the outward; and conſequently, no act in its ſelf Idolatrous; or of it ſelf. And thus have we brought the matter to that paſs, to relieve diſtreſſed Catholiques, that ordinary Heathens may evade the charge of Idolatry, though they never knew the true God.

                  </p>
                  <p>For though it doth not hold conſtantly true, that thoſe two words are ſo diſtinguiſhed in Scripture or Ancient Greek Writers, either Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Prophane, as not ſometimes to be uſed promiſcuouſly and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably as might by inſtances be made undeniable, yet cannot we not deny, but generally they have their diſtinct ſignifications, and the things by them ſignified are very diſtinct: and it is one of the eaſieſt things in the world, to put a difference between the Notions of <hi>servile</hi> Worſhip (which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55232:243"/>
is <hi>Dulia;</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> which is <hi>Latria:</hi> yet in the exerciſe of theſe acts, it is one of the difficulteſt things of all, to diſtinguiſh, which is which: ſeeing it is hard to ſay, whether the intention of the worſhipper only, or the Act it ſelf preciſely taken, or the Object, makes the worſhip Divine. The Object cannot be it, becauſe there could be no Idolatry committed in ſuch caſes: For, as is ſaid, If the worſhip be not Divine the Act cannot be Idolatrous; for all other worſhip (ſay they) may be exhibited to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And it ſhould not be Divine, according to this opinion, that maketh the Object to give the Divineneſs to the Act. Again, there can inſtance be given in to one act, that in it ſelf is incommunicable to the Creature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe mens <hi>Theology.</hi> Therefore laſtly, all the ſpecification of Idolatrous acts muſt conſiſt in the Intention of the mind, and that intention is ſeen in a profeſſion of Religiouſly worſhipping a thing for its own ſake: For ſo <hi>Azorius</hi> holdeth, that even <hi>Latria</hi> (which it any act with them be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Divine, muſt needs be ſo) <hi>it ſelf may be given to Saints, and to Images, provided it be not given for their own ſakes, but for Gods ſake.</hi> Now, it being impoſſible that any rational man ſhould thus ſtrictly give, or intend to give Divine Worſhip to any thing for its own ſake, which he denies to be<note place="margin">

                  <p>But it is time now to conſider the ſecond main ſhelter, from the charge of Idolatry made againſt the Roman Church; and that is from the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Material</hi> Idolatry: by which they would perſwade us that, firſt, having a certain knowledge of the true God; and next al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intending moſt ſincerely to worſhip only that true God, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they ſhould err in the object, yet the crime of Idolatry cannot cleave unto them; and eſpecially when we hear them ſo ſolemnly and zealouſly proteſt againſt worſhipping any Creature, what ever we can poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in, as God. The vanity of this proteſtation we may have occaſion to diſcover by and by. Now we call in queſtion the foundation of all; and that is, their diſtinction of <hi>Formal and Material Idolatry,</hi> upon this four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account: Firſt, that if it were reaſonable, it were notwithſtanding altogether ſuperfluous: For, what more can be honeſtly implied hereby, than was of old, in that diſtinction of <hi>Ignorantia facti</hi> and <hi>Juris, Ignorance of the thing done; and Ignorance of the Law againſt which this fact is committed.</hi> Ignorance, that ſuch a Law there is, which prohibits divine or ſupream worſhip to be given to the Creature, no man can plead: but Ignorance of actual Idolatry in ſuch kind of worſhip, as by error and falſe ſuppoſition is committed, a man may poſſibly alledge, and that colourably. Now, what can they make Formal Idolatry, but ſuch a Divine Worſhip as is given to that which is not God, knowingly and willingly? And what elſe do they mean by Material Idolatry, but Divine Worſhip falſely applied to that which by nature is not capable of it, as not God, though it be really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be God? And what is this elſe but Ignorance of the fact? And if ſo what makes this new Invented diſtinction here of <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Material</hi> Idolatry? Secondly, this diſtinction is very rudely and ignorantly made againſt the Rules of Logick. I know there is nothing more ordinary than to diſtinguiſh a thing, and conſider it <hi>Materially</hi> and <hi>Formally:</hi> but there never was received any ſuch diviſion as good, which made Matter and Form of the ſame thing, diſtinct Kinds; or made Parts ſeveral Species. A man may be conſidered according to his Matter or according to his Form: but who ever went about to divide human nature or humanity into a <hi>Formal Man</hi> and a <hi>Material Man?</hi> Or, to take an inſtance nearer to our purpoſe, of Adultery; A man may conſider it in its Formality and Materiality, but no adviſed man can divide Adultery into <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Material.</hi> For the general Rule makes againſt all ſuch attempts; which tells us, that nothing can be, or ſubſiſt without its form: ſo that
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:55232:244"/>
either there is no Adultery or Idolatry at all, or it muſt be as well For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal as Material: unleſs we would be ſo vain and ridiculous to call them <hi>Formal,</hi> as we ſometimes do a <hi>Formal Man,</hi> when he is phantaſtical and affected: or we ſhould uſe the term <hi>Formal,</hi> for that which doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all its outward formalities, as we before diſtinguiſhed Schiſme into <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Real,</hi> or Material, or Vertual and Formal. And in this ſenſe the contrary ſenſe is much more true. For in exhibiting outward worſhip in Divine manner, unto that which is not God, all the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Idolatry do appear; what ever the intention, which doth not appear, may be. It will here doubtleſs be ſaid, that in that common caſe put by Caſuiſts, of a Man who companies with a woman in a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal way, ſtedfaſtly and unfainedly believing that ſhe is his own lawful wife, doth commit material adultery, but not formal; and ſo in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as the caſe may be put: But I make no doubt to affirm, that ſuch an Act of Adultery, ſo far as it is Adultery, and ſuch Idolatry, ſo far as it is Idolatry, are both Formal as well as Material: and the only difference between them and thoſe they call <hi>Formal,</hi> conſiſts only in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or knowledge of the Fact done: For either ſuch Acts are ſins, or not ſins: If not ſins, then neither Formal nor Material Adultery, or Idolatry; if they be ſins, to what can they be reduced but to Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Idolatry? And that when they have the moſt favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they are ſinful: <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> thus clearly determines, <hi>If a</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Si quis mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem cagnoſcat non ſuam pro uxore, vel ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Luciferum, &amp;c. <hi>Gulielm. Pariſienſis de Leg. c. 21.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>man knows a woman not his own, for his own wife; or worſhips Lucifer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Chriſt, he ſins; becauſe God would have turn'd away his heart from ſuch a great Evil, if his ſins hindered not, which he had before committed.</hi> Thus he. So that the iſſue of this queſtion comes truly to that which ſome Romaniſts acknowledge, that all Idolatry derives it ſelf original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the underſtanding, though it be an Act of the will principally: and that it is becauſe a man knows not actually what he does, when he commits Idolatry. For ſurely, unleſs (to grant ſomething to quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, which prejudices little our Cauſe) we except ſome prodigious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and deſperate: no man worſhips what he is perſwaded is not God, with ſupream worſhip; and ſo conſequently, no man commits wilful Idolatry. And therefore, the only equal way of eſtimating the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalneſs of Idolatry, is from the meaſure of knowledge in man: and the means of diſcerning an Increated from a Created Object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It is therefore to very little purpoſe, that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato,</hi> and after him, <hi>Forbes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edinburge,</hi> and after them, other very learned men of theſe preſent days, alledge in excuſe of Papiſts from Idolatry in the Maſs, when they accept of their deteſtation of worſhiping Bread, or any thing Created, but only God: For 'tis no demonſtration or proof at all, that they do not do it, becauſe they ſay they do not do it: For here are two contrary ſuppoſitions made by contrary Parties. The one holds that the natural bodies of the Euchariſtical Elements are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor have any being: the other holds that they are there, as really as ever. Again, both agree that they worſhip that which is there, what ever it be: therefore deny they it a thouſand times, they have nothing to ſave themſelves from the actual adoration of thoſe Creatures, but a ſuppoſition that they are not there: but our opinion affirming poſitively that there they are, no man of us can hold opinion that they worſhip not the Creature, and<note place="margin">Maimonides More Neboc.

                  <p>Therefore if actually a man worſhips that which is not God, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to worſhip only the true God, can relieve him no farther, than his opinion and intention to accompany with his own wife, excuſes him from <hi>Caſual Adultery,</hi> in lying with another woman: and that is but little, unleſs circumſtances be ſuch as may render the ignorance of the Fact invincible (as they ſay) or unavoidable: And the intention and opinion, if they be againſt ordinary preſumptions to the contrary, do not excuſe. Now, to apply it to the laſt Caſe of Chriſt corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament: This is agreed upon by us, that what Chriſt ſaith to be ſo, is infallibly true, ſeem it never ſo contrary to our outward ſenſes. But ſeeing the words of Chriſt, according to the like expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Holy Writ, where things that bear Analogy with one another, are ſaid poſitively to be one another, (as where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Believers are Chriſts bone, and Chriſts fleſh,</hi> which is not true in the natural ſenſe, but Metaphorical; for otherwiſe, unbelievers might be ſaid ſo to be, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> never intended) do not neceſſarily infer that ſenſe; and all the ends imaginable are attainable no leſs by the ſpiritual ſenſe, and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical acceptation of the words, than by the more groſs and natural: And laſtly, to ſuppoſe what is ſaid above concerning this ſubject, teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſenſes bear witneſs to the contrary, as much after Conſecration as before; the upſhot of the buſineſs will be this, Whether there remains any ſuch infallible inducements to produce an opinion of ſuch a thing there being; whether ſuch gounds unreſiſtible there be for to found ſuch an intention, that may excuſe from errour.

                     <hi>themſelves, corporally, but yet after a ſpiritual, miraculous and imperceptible manner;</hi> we grant the manner to be wonderful and imperceptible, but we cannot grant it to be <hi>Corporally</hi> and <hi>Spiritually</hi> in the ſame reſpect, without a contradiction: For, What is <hi>corporally</hi> to receive a thing, but <hi>modo corporali, after a corporal manner,</hi> and therefore to correct, as it were, that Expreſſion with that which follows, <hi>viz.

And it is much more intelligible than that of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> which ſaith, That the Body of Chriſt may be received ſpiritually and bodily: For the body, according to them, is taken into the mouth, and ſo bodily received by the wicked, and unbelievers; and it is by the faithful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides received by Faith, ſpiritually, which may ſtand together: But to ſuppoſe any ſpiritual way to explicatory of the corporal way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt, is to ſuppoſe contradictions: But this belongs to another place.</p>
                  <p>Let us now touch the third exception I make againſt the diſtinction of <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal</hi> Idolatry, taken from the Novelty of it, and ſingularity, as never heard of before late dayes; when extremities put mens wits to ſtudy for new forms of Speech, to dreſs up the new body of Divinity framed to themſelves: Why did not the Heathen come off ſo? For ſurely they might: Why did not this enter into the head of the ancienter School-men, who, I dare ſay, make no mention of it? How comes it about that the aneient Fathers and Councils knew no other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry than that which even moderner Papiſts approve of, when the ſoberer mode is on them, <hi>viz.</hi> The worſhipping as God, that which is not God; without any notice taken of Material and Formal worſhip? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves with the general diſtinction of <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Fact:</hi> or wilful Ignorance, and unwilling: Or vincible and invincible. Surely this implies ſomewhat ſingular in this caſe, which they either are aſhamed to expreſs, or can not; which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is my caſe: For, I confeſs, I ſee no reaſon why we may not diſtinguiſh two ſorts of Hereſie as well, two ſorts of Schiſm, two ſorts of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, two ſorts of Drunkenneſs and Murder, Material and Formal, as of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry: And yet we hear little or no mention of this diſtinction, but only as it is applyed to Idolatry; which, beſides what is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, renders it more ſuſpected; and the coyners and uſers of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, The dangerouſneſs of this diſtinction, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent damage it doth to Chriſtian Religion, declares it to be wicked and intollerable; while it both opens a way to all careleſſneſs in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping,

                  <p>And thus have we ſeen what havock is made with Idolatry; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my, perhaps private, opinion is this, that God hath made that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt eaſie and obvious unto us, which is moſt neceſſary to be done, or avoided by us; and Idolatry is the greateſt of all ſins, next to Atheiſm; and therefore ſhould be moſt eaſie to be judged of, and apprehended; ſuch and ſo many have been of late the ſubtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>True it is, That it is aſſented unto generally by Chriſtians on all ſides almoſt, that it is Idolatry to worſhip any thing as God which is not, but we are little the nearer for this, becauſe it is made ſo doubtful and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judg, what is divine and proper worſhip. And ſecondly, when we intend ſuch worſhip to a falſe God, which happens to be given: For, upon ſuppoſal that we do worſhip a falſe Deity, yet if we intend to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip only the true, all is well and ſafe: But then, if it be doubted (as well it may) ſeeing all men naturally deſire and intend to worſhip the true God, how there ſhould be any Idolaters in the world, or any ſuch ſin as Idolatry: This difficulty hath much perplexed the Patrons of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> and <hi>Material</hi> Idolatry: For the Heathens themſelves could ſcarce, if ſuch a diſtinction may be allowed, be convinced of the one; and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may eaſily be convinced of the other: For, I ſee nothing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence replied to the inſtances of the learned amongſt the reformed, whereby it doth plainly appear, That the wiſer Heathens (and if we go no further our turn is ſerved) did not ony, as all men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worſhip the true God, but in their writings and minds<note place="margin">Gage Hiſtor.

Yes, ſaid the Chriſtians, but we do not ſo worſhip the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but we worſhip the true God beſides, knowing very well that thoſe things before us are not God: And ſo do we, replied the Heathens: We know very well, that this we ſee is not God himſelf, but we worſhip our God by this; and have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that he anſwers us by this, as well as yours: What thoſe
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55232:246"/>
Chriſtians did anſwer this, is not ſaid; neither could they ſay any thing whereby they ſhould excuſe themſelves and juſtly accuſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſhall ſo defend and explain themſelves, of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>Therefore of late hath a very grave and learned perſon pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unheard of opinion concerning this, to ſalve the reputation of Chriſtians labouring under this grand imputation; which is this, That there is no Idolatry, but where more Gods than one are worſhipped: The ground and motive to which opinion is this; becauſe, he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips more than one God, muſt inevitably worſhip a falſe God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but one True God: The incluſive part of which opinion and argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That, without all excuſe, ſuch are Idolaters, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant,; but not the excluſive: That only ſuch, and no others, are: And my reaſons are theſe; Firſt, becauſe none of the Chriſtian Fathers of old ever framed or received ſuch a Reſtriction of Idolatry: and that they did not, I need no better argument than may be taken from the learned Author himſelf, of this opinion: For being ſo throughly verſt in antiquity as he was, ſome ſuffrage of the Fathers, ſome record of the Church muſt needs have fallen into his hands, and ſo undoubtedly would have fallen from his pen, confirming his opinion; but none we find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Secondly, I ſee no reaſon of departing without greater neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than hath appeared as yet, from the conſonant judgment hitherto of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> which, though it hath not in a formal decree, declared this point; yet ſo far as her opinion doth appear in the writings of the Principal of the Church; it is to the oppoſing of that ſence of Idolatry; as hath in part been ſhown by others, and make no doubt but might further, by the ſame hand, as he affirmeth; finding it not difficult to do it my ſelf. Thirdly, They, for relief of whom, ſurely this opinion was chiefly thought of and aſſerted, will not own the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, though they like nothing more, and alledg nothing oftner to retuod the force of our arguments proving them Idolatrous, than the judgment of ſo learned a man as he, againſt us, and in defenſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet they certainly diſliking the Premiſes upon which ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is inferred, and ſticking only to the Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are not guilty of Idolatry, can take no more ſhelter from thence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, than can he that denies the Concluſion and grants the Premiſes: For, I would thus expoſtulate, firſt, with the Author; Whether, if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention directed rightly doth not excuſe from Idolatry, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> may not be ſaid to be Idolatrous? I make no queſtion but he that holds, as he doth, that there is no tranſubſtantiation, would grant they were, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition: Again I would demand, whether if this ground be falſe which is ſuppoſed as true, by him: That all Idolatry implys a plurality of Gods worſhipped; He that worſhips one falſe God may not be ſaid to be an Idolater? I ſee no reaſon to doubt but he that held there was any ſuch thing in the world, would, and muſt yield to the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is, ſuppoſing that there is Idolatry not conſiſting in more Gods than one. Now the Papiſts do certainly, not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but hold, that Idolatry may be committed in worſhiping one God, who is falſly ſo called; and therefore though, according to his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> they may defend themſelves, yet neither according to their own grounds, nor ours. Fourthly, The ground of that his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not to be allowed: For this it is, That divine Adoration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:55232:247"/>
its ſpecification from the intention: which is an act principally of the will, ſo, that be the object what it will, yet if I have no intention to worſhip any other than the true God, I worſhip him, when I direct my worſhip to that which we may ſuppoſe not to prove, upon tryal, God: But this is not to be granted, that intention is ſufficient to denominate worſhip, or conſtitute it true and Catholick; though it ſuffices abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to make a worſhip falſe, when it is intended for ſuch: And then may a man be ſaid to intend falſe worſhip, not only when he knows it to be falſe; but when he might poſſibly know it to be ſo, and when he intends to worſhip that which actually is a falſe object: For, as hath been ſaid, Idolatry conſiſts principally in the underſtanding; as alſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intimateth, when it charges the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with ignorance<note place="margin">2 King. 17. 26.

                  <p>FROM what hath paſſed, may we with greater expedition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what remains of the Object of Worſhip, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, even to Idolatry, committed in worſhipping of Saints and Angels, not only in themſelves, but Reliques: For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Prayer to them, or invocation of them is a proper Act of adoration; no man doubts it: And therefore, ſee in what degree men pray to them, they worſhip them, as likewiſe what outward honor they give them, or their Remains, or Images.</p>
                  <p>And for the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, as alſo their Reliques, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch, we allow due reſpect, proper for ſuch Objects: But for the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saints we know none proper to them, as not at all belonging to them, no part of them, bearing no relation to them, but as it ſhall pleaſe vain men to appoint it: Yet though we hold no reverence at all is due to the Image of Saints or Angels for their own ſakes, or for the ſakes of them they repreſent, yet alſo hold we it unlawful to offer any indignity to them, unleſs conſtrained from the abuſes and ſuperſtitions uſed toward them; which when they arrive at that height as to be made objects,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:55232:249"/>
mediate or immediate of religious worſhip, may lawfully ſuffer the ſame fate with the brazen Serpent, in <hi>Hezechiah's</hi> dayes.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of Invocation of Saints, in any ſenſe: How can we ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wonder at the uncertainty, yea contradiction of the greateſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of it; Whereof not only ſome affirm and ſome deny, but the ſame Perſons ſometimes affirm, and ſometimes deny any ſuch thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired or mentioned in Scripture. <hi>Pighius</hi> and <hi>Cope</hi> give their reaſon why Saints were not worſhipped under the Old Teſtament, to be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not then partakers of the beautiful Viſion, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:<note place="margin">Bellar. de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titud. Sanct. l. 1. c. 19.</note> And this reaſon gives <hi>Bellarmin</hi> likewiſe; yet for all that preſums to alledg the words of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 48. very ridiculouſly. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he confeſſed the Old Teſtament afforded no Preſidents or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for it. Secondly, becauſe thoſe words have quite another Senſe than that he would draw them to: I ſhall therefore cut off all that may be anſwered to the frivolous allegation of Scripture, in that behalf; as, duly examined, making more ſuſpected of error than point, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it: ſo very violent is the uſe of them: And enquire rather firſt about the manner, and then the reaſon, and laſtly the Authority or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for this, very briefly.</p>
                  <p>Of the three ſeveral diſtinct wayes wherein we are ſaid to pray unto Saints one is not to pray to Saints, at all; but unto God: For, the firſt nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by learned men, which is <hi>to pray to God that upon intuition, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Saints worth, or prayers, or interceſſion he would hear us, doth not</hi> make Saints at all the Object of our prayers; but the ſubject, or matter of them: which whether convenient to be uſed or not, is beſides our preſent queſtion, and belonging to another place; and therefore may well be paſſed over, and rather granted to be lawful and uſeful than diſputed: For certainly, he that petitions a King to grant him any thing for ſuch a Favorites ſake, who is about him, and is his friend, doth not thereby petition ſuch a Courtier himſelf: And this may be proved out of the ancient offices of the Church. A ſecond way is, when we directly pray to them, but not Particularly; ſuppoſing they ſhould either particularly underſtand all that we do, or beg; but by a general Petition deſiring that they would pray for us. A Third way is, when we deſire of Saints and Angels ſuch things as are proper only to God to give us: As if we ſhould pray unto them to forgive us our ſins, to give us grace of mind, and health of Body: But theſe two do not ſeem to be diſtinct kinds, but only differing in extent and matter: For in the firſt, a man doth make the matter of his requeſt, that they would promote that requeſt which tendeth principally to God; and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately. In the ſecond, that they would procure to them the things prayed for; which two differ in degrees, not kind of Invocation.</p>
                  <p>Again they are wont here alſo to diſtinguiſh of <hi>Civil</hi> worſhip and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious:</hi> And of Religious worſhip again into <hi>Divine</hi> proper, and <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi> As for the former, I ſee no reaſon, how common ſoever it is, to grant any ſuch thing to Saints or Angels: ſeeing all the ground of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil reverence given from one to another, as in profeſſion of our ſervice honor and obedience to our Parent, Maſters or Governors, wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon our civil, and viſible communion with them, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Acts paſſing from one to another; which communion or relation is extinguiſhed quite by their natural death and departure out of this world; as appeareth in the moſt intimate of all relations between men
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:55232:249"/>
in this world, which is that of Man and Wife; which Nature, Reaſon, and the Scripture teach us to be as free, as if they had never met together, or known one another, after the deceaſe of either.

                  <p>It is moſt apparent, that God, neither in Old nor New Teſtament, hath given any ſuch warrant as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did to <hi>Haman</hi> to exalt <hi>Mordecai;</hi> or <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to honor <hi>Joſeph;</hi> for us to honor Saints in exhibiting any thing of divine worſhip to them. I ſhall not need therefore trouble this place with their citations to that purpoſe, which is not to the purpoſe, when it was there manifeſt to all, that ſuch honor was the honor not of a King, but a principal ſubject and Miniſter of ſtate. Neither do Scriptural reaſons advance their cauſe: Whereof ſome are ſo parabolical and forced, that they fall to nothing before they come to us: as that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 26. and that of Saint <hi>Peter; 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 14. 15. being plainly intended of the records he would leave with them he wrote to, to bear in memory what he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them; as <hi>Cajetane</hi> hath noted: And the Power promiſed <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26. to them that overcome, is not (as they violently give out) a power to diſpenſe bleſſings, and therefore to be ſought to by Invocation: but a power to be victorious in the Faith againſt all perſecutions: And thoſe reaſons drawn from <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. 8. and 6. 10. and 8. 3, 4.

True it is (as hath been noted before) that the Viſion of the Apoſtle is implyed to have been in Heaven concerning things there revealed to him; but it was of things only to be fulfilled on earth. And though it is moſt eaſie, fit, and obvious to interpret the <hi>Angel</hi> offering incenſe, as the ſervent prayers of the holy Saints upon
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55232:250"/>
earth to God the Father; yet it is, I conceive, more literal and agreeable to the intent of the Revelations made, to interpret them partly as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of things <hi>doing then</hi> in the Church, and partly as propheſies of the future condition of the Church, in the publique Service of God; where, by the <hi>Angel</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who in the firſt dayes of the Church was wont in preſence and behalf of the people to offer up the common prayers of the People at the golden Altar, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſpecial place of his miniſtration; which prayers and worſhip did, like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, aſcend unto the holy Throne of God: And the fire which is ſaid to be caſt from the Cenſer and Altar unto the earth, is nothing elſe but the ſervent prayers of the Saints offered by their Miniſter to God; for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor againſt them on the earth, which ſo miſerably perſecuted and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Chriſtians: upon which Gods judgments fell on the earth, after the manner of voices and thunderings and lightnings and earthquakes. But <hi>Eccius</hi> and <hi>Cope</hi> gives us a Reaſon why the Apoſtles left no precept or directions to us in the new Teſtament to give the worſhip, now plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for as due to Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt it might ſeem a piece of arrogance in them to ſeek ſuch honor: Well, be this reaſon true or falſe, it matters not; it ſeems plainly by this, no ſuch things is to be found in the New Teſtament, and this ſuffices us againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Let us next briefly enquire, What preſcription from Antiquity they have for it.

If the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do know what are our thoughts, (as they muſt, our voice condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing little or nothing to the making them capable of our meanings at that diſtance of place and condition they are in) it is more than we can poſſibly know; and ſo in a manner as much as if it were not at all, to us: If they have ſuch Charity as is pretended, greater much than is to be found in holy men on earth, (which is moſt probable) yet that it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to us, or to one man above another, as it was upon earth, I believe not: For all Affections being founded (I do not ſay managed) upon carnal or fleſhly nature, ceaſeth with the body; and the Charity being clearly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated and directed infallibly by their knowledg or viſion, ſo as it was not here, cannot be exerciſed but according to that Light, and that Rule

They have therefore indeed greater Charity as to the purity and intenſeneſs of it, which is Charity Triumphant, but not Militant, according to which laſt only they are ſaid to aſſiſt us by their prayers: And, yet this I may add, That as the interceſſion of Saints in Heaven for us is no wayes to be allowed to be vocal or proper, as on earth, nor by any ſpecial act direct to God on the behalf of their Friends and Fellow-members on earth, for the reaſon now given; ſo may they not be denyed all influence upon God in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of grace and benefits to us on earth; as God doth pleaſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their Labor of Love not only for themſelves, but fellow-members here below.</p>

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55232:252"/>
Scripture. But the ſecond commandment againſt all Images in order to worſhip or reverence, hath prov'd ſuch a bone, that it hath broke the teeth of all that would break it: <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Catechiſm ſtateth the cauſe thus: <hi>Before the coming of Chriſt, when the Iſraelites were very rude and dull, all Imagery was prohibited them. for fear of Idolatry: But now ſince all Paganiſm is extinguiſhed by the Light of the Goſpel, the danger is not the ſame, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperstition ſhould lurk ſtill in the minds of Chriſtians, it may eaſily be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thence by holy Doctrine. Until the age of St. Hierom were certain men of ſound Religion which would endure no Images at all in Churches, either painted, or graven, or wrought, no not of Chriſt: I ſuppoſe, by reaſon of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites: yet by little and little</hi> (Where are they then that with ſo much importunity and little reaſon call for the very time preciſely wherein corruptions entered into the Church; or elſe will not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?) <hi>the uſe of Images entred into Churches: And perhaps there would be no undecency, if in ſuch places as God is ſerved in ſolemnly no images ſhould be placed, ſaving the Image of Chriſt crucified: But Pictures if they were duly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, beſides the honeſt pleaſure they bring, conduce very much to memory and underſtanding of hiſtory—Yea the learned many times ſee more in Pictures than Letters; and are more vehemently affected: And as the Ancient Church prohibited all books, not canonical, to be uſed in Churches, ſo perhaps were it not amiſs, if all kinds of Pictures of things not contained in Holy Scripture were excluded.</hi> To this effect and almoſt in theſe very words he: To which we muſt ſo far aſſent, as to yield a poſſible good effect of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Devotion ariſing from ſuch outward occaſions as Pictures, yet conſidering, God hath no where laid any obligation upon us to profit by ſuch helps, as he hath to advance our ſelves in knowledg and Chriſtian vertues by conſulting Holy Scriptures, and how great and manifeſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of falling into Idolatry by them, there is; it were more pious and ſafe to interdict the falling down before, as well as to them: man being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as prone to Idolatry as to unlawful carnal copulation.</p>
                  <p>But whereas <hi>Eraſmus</hi> proceedeth to defend Images, becauſe God in the Old Law commanded to make <hi>Cherubins</hi> and <hi>Seraphins</hi> about the Ark, <hi>Tertullian</hi> anſwereth, <hi>That ſo may we too when we have the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:</hi> For though God ties us up ſtrictly to his Laws, he doth not ſo tye himſelf, but when he pleaſes he may give us a diſpenſation: But beſides<note place="margin">Vid.

                  </argument>
                  <p>VVE come now to ſpeak of the Fifth General, wherein the exerciſe of Gods worſhip conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that is <hi>Preaching,</hi> of which having ſo far already treated as to make diſcovery of the great error of Sectaries about it; and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious abuſe of the true and proper Worſhip of God, by Idolizing a Sermon, and making the Houſe of God, and all acts of Religion, void, in compariſon of it; we may be here briefer in what remains of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: For, we find an opinion too prevalent amongſt Chriſtians which not only overthroweth the worſhip of God for Preachings ſake; but which is more to be wonder'd at, overthroweth Preaching too, for the Sermons ſake: For to that Superſtition are they arrived in their opinions of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing; that if it be not performed without book, if not out of the Pulpit, if not a text formally taken out of the Bible, If this text be not reduced to Doctrine and Uſe: If there be not a formal (I do not mean a Form of) Prayer before, and after it, with the common ſort, it ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55232:254"/>
the name of Preaching: And when all thoſe conditions concur, it is not only Preaching and a Sermon indeed, but the Word of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado; and accordingly to be reverenced and valued: And it were to be wiſh'd that were all, and the Scriptures themſelves not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, or not much liſten'd to, in compariſon of them. <hi>Thomas Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> the Great <hi>Church-wright</hi> (as I may ſo call him) of Schiſmatiques, hath expreſly affirm'd, That the Scriptures avail little unleſs expounded, [by themſelves ſurely] and yet they alſo hold an opinion, which no man can reconcile to this, that the Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to Salvation, and that plainly; but let that go: And let us know how a Sermon in its formalities now mentioned, became the Word of God; and in what ſenſe, and in what age, and by what autority? It is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſeldom uſed a Prayer before, or after their Preaching. It is moſt apparent out of <hi>Juſtine Martyrs</hi> ſecond apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and <hi>Tertullians</hi> Apologetique, that Preaching was uſed in their publique Aſſemblies; and that principally as ſubſervient to Prayer and Communicating, and not ſet to domineer over them, and be made the chief of Gods worſhip: And ſo long as their Prayers were unpreſcribed, was Preaching unſtudied for, and extemporary chiefly; according to the manner inſinuated in the Acts of the Apoſtles, where it is ſaid: <hi>After the reading of the Law and Prophets the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts. 13. 15.</note> (<hi>Paul</hi> and his company) <hi>ſaying, Ye men and Brethren, If ye have any word of Exhortation for the People ſay on:</hi> And by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 29, 30.</note> ſaying; <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the reſt judge: If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his Peace.</hi> Theſe ſpeeches were after the Preſident of the Jewiſh Aſſembly had either himſelf read, or cauſed the Law to be read, and never without leave firſt obtained from him: Which cuſtom was for ſome time imitated by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: When the Biſhop only firſt ſpake to the people, and then by his leave ſome other began an Exhortation to the People: But this bringing certain inconveniences into Chriſtian Aſſemblies, in tract of time quite ceaſed; and nothing was ſaid but by the Biſhop himſelf; and that not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time, much leſs in every place where Chriſtians aſſembled to the Service of God; there being for a long time after Chriſtians were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and ſpread far, not above one Sermon in a Dioceſs; and that in the Principal City of that Country: whither people, that had a mind to hear a Sermon or communicate, reſorted for the good of their ſouls, as men do now adayes to Market, for the food of their bodies. Which being there purchaſed, the faithful Chriſtian carried it home to his Family, and diſpenſed to it of the ſame: following herein the Counſel of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 35.</note> women ſhould ask their husbands, and learn at home. And St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> often exhorts his hearers to conſider of what they hear in publique, at home, and meditate of the Scriptures at home: which was either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with every mans ſelf, or to ſuch as could not have acceſs to the Publique.</p>
                  <p>And this publique way of Preaching had for a long time no preſcribed ſubject, but what the Biſhop thought proper or ſeaſonable for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Exhortation, was uttered by him: But in Saint <hi>Bafils, Nazianzens, Chryſostoms,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Sermons we find mention made of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read before; and Sermons made by way of Expoſition of them; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner that Epiſtles and Goſpels are in uſe with us, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as proper ſubjects, to inſtruct Chriſtian People; the one giving us
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55232:254"/>
matter of Inſtruction from the hiſtory of the Life, Doctrine, Miracles, and Death of our only Saviour Chriſt; and the other, principally moving us to the exerciſe of all Chriſtians Graces and Vertues, conformable to our calling and knowledg of God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Far were our Chriſtian Anceſtors (and well they might) from the modern perſwaſion of Erratick Chriſtians, that the Sermon was more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than the Scriptures; or that reading of the Scriptures was not Preaching, or that Catechizing and inſtructing Novices in Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was not Preaching. I confeſs, I am of opinion, that there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to be made between a <hi>Preaching</hi> and a <hi>Sermon;</hi> taking here a <hi>Sermon</hi> for an Oration made by un-Chriſtian, as well as Chriſtian Orators, to inform and perſwade to what they aimed at, in ſuch ſpeeches. And no inſtance can be given of any Orator Gentile or Chriſtian for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, that preſumed to ſpeak to the People out of his own writings rehearſed to them (Poets were wont in Publique to recite their verſes in Publique out of their book) by reading; and therefore could never in my judgment comply with the very modern practiſe of it; there being no reaſon why it ſhould be more tolerated in Divine than Humane Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or why, ſetting the cuſtome of the place aſide (which muſt needs be corrupt and abſurd, as it is ſingular and new) it is leſs ridiculous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe a Divine Oration which we call a Sermon, by reading, than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. I am ſure the ancient Fathers whom we pretend to imitate, and all modern Churches without exception of any, but our own, abhor it: And are not at all ſenſible of the vulgar arguments weight to juſtifie it, <hi>viz. becauſe the matter is the ſame, And what difference is there between a Sermon deliver'd without reading, and with it; if the hearer ſees him not or looks not on him that Preaches.</hi> But it is very expedient the Hearers eye ſhould be attent, as well as his ear; and yet that is not all might be ſaid neither, but all I will here ſay.</p>
                  <p>But undoubtedly they erregregiouſly on the other hand, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſuch ſermoning as we now ſpeak of, is only Preaching, according to the mind of the Apoſtle; and that which is the only proper means of Salvation: We are not ſaved but by Faith, we cannot believe but by hearing, we cannot hear without a Preacher; as the Apoſtle, moſt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably, concluding from thence the abſolute neceſſity of Preaching: But what Preaching? When I ſaid Recitation of a Speech concerning divine matters and our Salvation, was not properly a Sermon or Oration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pronounced after the univerſal Law of all Orators: (which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate things aright) I ſaid not that it was not Preaching; taking preaching from the end of it, and not ſo much from the form. The end is undoubtedly, knowledg, firſt, of the Chriſtian Faith: The next end, is Aſſent to that Doctrine of Faith: The third end is, Obedience to the Faith: The laſt end is, the Salvation of ſuch a true believer: Now all theſe may, without doubt, be obtained without the Forms of Oratory; and by ſo many wayes as we are made capable of theſe great ends, ſo many wayes are we preacht to: And therefore, reading to, and writing to another (as the Apoſtles did their their Epiſtles to ſeveral Churches,) or any communication may be called the word of God and Preaching, as really as the moſt Oratorical Sermon: Though ſtill, conſidering the nature of man, and the ordinary courſe of perſwading, ſettled all the world over, I cannot grant that ſuch wayes are ſo effectual or operative upon the partakers of the ſame inſtructions.</p>

                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:55232:255"/>By what is ſaid, may be gathered what I propounded at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in what ſenſe Preaching and Hearing may be reduced to the Worſhipping of God, and become part of his Service: For, taking the ſervice of God ſtrictly and properly, neither of both of them are ſuch; but they are a neceſſary foundation to build our worſhip of God on. They have of late dayes amongſt Sectaries, been called, <hi>The Means,</hi> in ſo high and ſignal ſenſe, as if they need ſay no more, and they comprehended all Religious acts eminently, which is nothing ſo.

                     <hi>to teach the doctrine of the Incarnation of Chriſt; and of his three Offices, his Kingly Office, his Prophetical Office, and his Prieſthood, with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof.</hi> This, in good earneſt, is ſo much Preaching of Chriſt, that ſcarce any thing elſe is meant in Holy Scriptures, where it ſpeakes ſo much of Preaching of Chriſt; they ayming chiefly thereby at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Chriſt, as the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed of Old; and then come into the world: What is ſaid above this, is, or may be true, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſides the Letter of the Scripture. <hi>Secondly, to teach that Faith is an Inſtrument ordained of God to apprehend and apply Chriſt with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</hi> Which is very true in the ſignification of Faith common, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is taken for that Complex Evangelical Grace, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all particular Chriſtian vertues and Graces ſpringing from that Head; but not ſo, as Faith ſignifies now adayes, a ſingle Grace contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct to others. <hi>Thirdly, To certifie and reveal to every hearer that it is the will of God to ſave him by Chriſt, in particular, ſo he will receive Chriſt,</hi>—1 <hi>John.</hi> 1. 11. It were to be wiſhed, this Author had kept cloſer to this opinion here expreſſed. <hi>Fourthly, to certifie and to reveal to every particular hearer that he is to apply Christ with his benefits to himſelf in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and that effectually, by his Faith.</hi> Grant we now that this is to preach Chriſt; yet that this muſt be done in ſuch unnatural and uncouth manner both of Speech and Geſtures as are no leſs than ridiculous, we muſt not grant; this is for them who affect and uſe it, to preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Again, this preaching of Chriſt, or hearing of Chriſt thus preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not Worſhipping of God, as it hath been miſtaken groſſely to have been. The reading of the word of God was ever looked upon as a neceſſary part of the ſervice of God, amongſt Jews of Old, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to this day: Believers thereby declaring their Faith towards God, no ſmall act of ſerving God: But the Sermons of men ſince the Apoſtles, never till this ſuperſtitious age, were advanced to that eſteem or dignity: For, no man can, without derogation from the Scriptures, call them, though ſound and Scriptural, the <hi>word of God;</hi> but with limitations. Well, ſaith a learned and grave Preacher; <hi>However the whole Sermon is</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> Serm. 33. on Whitſunday.</note> 
                     <hi>the ordinance of God, the whole Sermon is not the word of God;</hi> meaning that it is the Precept of God, that Chriſtian people ſhould be taught, by thoſe that have the ſpiritual care and tuition of their Souls; but that, what is taught is not worthy of the glorious title of the word of God, no though it be very agreeable unto it. It may much more properly be ſaid to be the will of God than the word of God.</p>
                  <p>But what falls ſhort in the nature, they hope to make up in the meaſure of their Worſhip. And therefore frequentation of Sermons, and painful preaching (as they call it) muſt, and doth carry it from all other Pretenſions to the true Service of God; and thoſe they traduce with the reproach of a lazy Miniſtry, muſt without farther diſpute yield to be reformed by them, and to their modes too. And truly, Induſtry and painfulneſs are ſuch undeniable vertues in all Moral and Civil matters, that no man can object againſt; no man but muſt commend: And in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al matters often ariſe to the nature of divine Graces, which are rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with proportionable glory; when the Great Lord of us all ſhall take an account of every ſervants improving his <hi>Talent,</hi> and to the fruitful, ſay, <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant; Thou haſt been faithful in a little, be
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55232:256"/>
thou ruler over much.</hi> But what is all this, and more which may be added to the nature of the work it ſelf, which God requires at our hands, as our bounden ſervice: as a man may do a good thing negligently, ſo he may do an ill thing diligently, and induſtriouſly: We are now enquiring whether Preaching be worſhipping God, or God is ſerved principally by it: If it be, then no doubt but diligence therein is the more commendable: But if it be not, as we have ſhewed it is not, then our diligence were better placed elſewhere, namely on that wherein conſiſteth more formally the worſhip of God, which is prayer. But what if after all this cry of Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs on their ſide rather than on their Adverſaries part, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is the lazy Miniſtry rather than ours, as in truth it is? I compare not here Perſons which would be infinite; but Religions: and the manner of Miniſtration and worſhip conſtituted by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that of any Sect whatever. Let them tell which Religion requires moſt vigilance, attendance, and pains: That which preſcribes every Pariſh-Prieſt to officiate three dayes in a week, and propounds dayly Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Publique place of worſhip, or that which ſets men free all the week unleſs on the Lords day: That which preſcribes ſo ſtrictly viſiting the ſick upon all occaſion, or that which is maintain'd chiefly by their Miniſter viſiting the Well, and gutling from houſe to houſe amongſt their favourers and benefactors of their Faction: That which obſerves or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the obſervation of conſtant Faſts, or that which derides them, and accuſes them contrary to all Examples of former Churches, of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That Religion which requires a punctual obſervation of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, which they profeſs to be grievous to them, not only becauſe it is a Liturgy preſcribed, but becauſe it is too long, and painful; or that which prayes, what it pleaſes, and as long, and ſhort as it pleaſes; and with what lazy, crude matter it pleaſes, never more troubling themſelves or being ſollicitous what or how they ſhall pray extemporary, than he is, or needs be that reads all out of the book: And ſurely it is leſs trouble thus to pray without book, than with it; to any man that will give his mind to it, or will boldly enough offer at it. And for their Sermons, what have they in them to commend them for elaborate, or the Speaker of them, for laborious? Have they not fallen into admiration of one kind of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and method in preaching, and which with ſo much Superſtition they cleave to, as neither to care nor dare to vary; that half their Sermons are made before they begin? For the Form they have conſtantly by them, and that ſhall ſerve for all texts, and occaſions whatever, and that brings the matter in naturally almoſt; and ſo neither their invention, nor memory are ſo pained or hard put to it, that they ſhould need to boaſt much of their painful Preaching: Surely then, it muſt be their preaching twice a day, that they have to truſt to, for being accounted deſervedly painful Preachers: But if we conſider how they that preach twice, ſpread and beat out their metal, and ſo ſlip it into two pieces, we ſhall perceive we have but two <hi>Six pences</hi> for a <hi>Shilling,</hi> which may make more noiſe, and number, but weigh no more than one: And, in truth, upon tryal, conſidering likewiſe, what conſtant Repetitions and Introductions they make to their ſecond Sermon, it will be found that to paſs to a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on Afternoons, by Catechizing, and treating for half an hour on the principal heads of Chriſtian doctrine, and worſhip, as it is more profitable and to the edification of the Generality, who are not puff'd up in their fleſhly mind with the name of preaching, and the place from
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55232:256"/>
whence it comes, the Pulpit, (which is their High Altar) ſo is it more difficult to the Performer of it. Now theſe things being ſo that there is as much work cut out by order of the Church for Miniſters to finiſh, as ordinarily one mans ſtrength of Body and Spirit can go through with, not prejudicing the health of him, (which God no ways requires) how ſpiteful and groundleſs is that charge, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have a lazy Miniſtry which they promiſe to out do, when they are uppermoſt? If theſe Rules and Preſcriptions of the Church which will certainly keep him from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs that obſerves them, more than their Diſcipline will, be not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as becometh, themſelves that accuſe are in fault chiefly, who have ſhamefully traduced and oppoſed the ſame, and to gratifie whom, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hath been countenanced too far in theſe things; And ſo are they (whoever they be) that can content themſelves with the titles, dignitys, and profits of Governors of the Church, and withdraw themſelves from their bounden duty and ſervice to it, in ſeeing better execution done. I know their Apology is the ſtrong hand of the Adverſary oppoſing their endeavors in that behalf, which would have juſtifyed and vindicated them much more than now it doth, if they had not given evidence of their little ſincerity and zeal for Religion in thoſe things, which were free and eaſie for them to do, and for which they might have thanks on all ſides: But Prudence forſooth, hath been ſo infinitely cryed up and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and that conſiſting chiefly in doing nothing, and offending no body, but God Almighty, that Piety and zeal are no better then incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Pragmatiqueneſs, the Rule moſt ſacredly obſerved by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, <hi>We do not do it, therefore it ought not, or need not be done.</hi> And thus while we are doubting what Government we ſhould have, and how we ſhould be ruled, are we made ſubject to the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of Pride, Folly and Lazineſs, nothing being done without their conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: But this belongs more properly to the next place.</p>

of Salvation to all them that obey him. Sometimes Obedience is in Scripture put for believing it ſelf, becauſe Faith is a principal act of the will bowing, and yielding to God aſſent; as in the Acts of the Apoſtles; <hi>We are his witneſses of theſe things, and ſo is alſo the Holy Ghoſt, whom God</hi>

And, infinite other places in holy writ are there, which deſcribe and require this obedience at our hands, as believers: For, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> well hath noted; <hi>It is no benefit at all to us to be Orthodox, ſo long as our lives are corrupt; as there is no profit of an exact Converſation, our Faith not being ſound.</hi> And <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> defines Piety, to <hi>be a Practiſe following and waiting on God.</hi>

To have a conſtant and clear eye of Faith in the preſence of God, believing and being throughly aſſured that he beholds, and obſerves, and notes, and weighs our thoughts, words, and actions: as ſurely had <hi>Enoch</hi> who walked with God. 5. 24.

A Recognition and owning of the Power, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Juſtice and Mercy of God. 3. A free and total Reſignation and ſubmiſſion of our ſelves to the will of God. 4. Patience and ſilence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Providence of God. 5. Conſtant and ſervent Invocation of God, as well for his helping, as healing and pardoning Grace. 6. A conſtant exerting and exerciſing of Gods Grace given unto us, by the proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, Hope, and Charity: And theſe ſeven by having a conſtant regard to the commands and precepts of God: To the Promiſes of God: To the Threatnings of God to all: To the Judgments of God executed upon others for their wickedneſs and diſobedience: To the Mercies of God ſingularly and plentifully conferred upon our ſelves: and laſtly to the Torments of Hell and Joyes of Heaven. Theſe are principally the things every good Chriſtian is to attend, that would add to his Faith vertue, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> adviſes; and devout walking with God to his ſound knowledg of him.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as Chriſt hath taught us, The ſecond Part of our Obedience to him, is like unto it, conſiſting in Love of our Neighbour; Which divideth it ſelf into two Parts, Doing him juſtice in all things: for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Romans: Love worketh no ill to its Neighbour, therefore Love is the</hi>

                  <p>But of all Juſtice, that is principally to be attended to, which ungodly hypocrites moſt contemn and violate, and that is of Obedience to our Superiours: For, whereas Chriſtian Religion obliges us to mutual offices<note place="margin">Eph. 4 2. Eph. 4. 21. Rom. 15. 1.</note> of Love and Charity one towards another, to forbear one another in love, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs and long ſuffering: And again, to ſubmit our ſelves one to another, in the fear of God: And that the ſtrong ſhould bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; certain Sectaries not having the Knowledg of God aright, or underſtanding in the Scriptures (in which they flatter themſelves, they know more than any other) or the true fear of God before their eyes, do ſo corrupt and pervert the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, as indeed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all that order of Government, Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church as neceſſary to the being of the true Faith it ſelf; though in ſome Formal language they would ſeem to allow of it: But this is only kept by them, as a reſerve to relieve and fortifie themſelves, when the time ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that they ſhall get the Sceptre of power into their hands, and the Face of Autority to ſhew to others: For then, all their petty aſſaults, by ſuch arguments as above ſaid, are diſown'd and rejected, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with all Order in Chriſts Church; and more ſevere exactions of obedience maintained than they groaned under before: Then are theſe texts of force, which otherwiſe ſignifie nothing, or are eluded with a ſigh, a wry look, ſad complaint and a profeſſion that they would ſubmit, but that their Conſciences will not ſuffer them; their conſciences being ſo ſtated as never to accept of any Rule but their own: Chriſt ſaith; <hi>He

                  <p>But it is not only the Puritans intollerable dogms againſt obedience, but the contrary practiſe of no ſmall perſons of place, and eſteem in the Church, who can heartily, and with zeal even to indignation, proſecute Sectaries inconformity to the Diſcipline and Rites of the Church, glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and boaſting that they are Sons of the Church, and yet do more miſchief to the Church by their ill govern'd perſons, as to common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, ſobriety and gravity, and more advance, and bring into credit, and reputation, the enemies of the Church, than all their fair and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences could otherwiſe poſſibly do.

And whereas it ſuppoſes as a foundation, natural juſtice, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and temperance, and the like moral vertues, to the divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Inſtitutions of Perfection: what may turn the ſtomach, and raiſe laughter more at a man, then for ſuch an one to diſcover his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe at an unceremonious Puritane, the matter of whoſe Crime is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to his? If thou beeſt a Chriſtian (ſaith a holy Father) either ſpeak as thou liveſt, or live as thou ſpeakeſt: What evil ſpirit hath ſet thee on firſt to abuſe thy ſelf with ſcandalous practiſes, and then the Church by taking Sanctuary in it? Can ſtupidity ſo far accompany vice, as firſt to break the known and common Laws and Rules of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which is affront enough to the Church, and then to add to that affront, by profeſſing a ſpecial duty to that, which thereby is deſtroyed? There is no Sect or Schiſm whoſe Orders and Laws of Chriſtian walking with God can be compared with thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there being nothing amongſt them, beſides Faith, which an <hi>Heathen</hi> may not do, that never heard of Chriſtian Perfection, accounting nothing needful to be done, nothing unlawful to them which is not puniſhable by the Law of man, or againſt the light of nature: Chriſt (they ſay) hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for them a liberty to do what they pleaſe, in eating, drinking ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and other matters, ſo that they wrong not their own bodies, nor injure their Neighbors; And ſhall there be that protect themſelves under this Churches ſhelter, in ſuch light, looſe, fooliſh and vitious courſes to the degrading of it beneath her inferiors? Is this to be ſons of the Church; and not only ſo but to brag that ſuch they are, in open hoſtility to it?</p>

                     <pb n="478" facs="tcp:55232:260"/>I confeſs notwithſtanding all this, in comparing the enemies to the true Faith together, we are to diſtinguiſh between the doers of evil ſimply, and the teachers of men ſo to do: And that though drunkenneſs and uncleaneſs, be greater ſins by far, in their nature, than is diſſent from a ceremony, or Rite not neceſſary in its nature: Yet for any man with a ſpirit of oppoſition and contention to take upon him to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an unneceſſary order, and teach men againſt the unity and peace of the Church, otherwiſe than becomes him, is no leſs criminal, in the conſequence, before God; yea probably much more than thoſe other more ſcandalous before men, and will more endanger his Soul.</p>
                  <p>But concerning ſuch perſons as are in profeſſion really Sons, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Fathers of the Church, and yet wilfully and ſtudiouſly violate the Laws, Conſtitutions, Rubricks, or Canons of it, no neceſſity compelling them, no reaſon being to be alledged defending them, but what is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from their eaſe, which otherwiſe would be much interrupted; or their benefit and profit which would be much hindred, I leave their own hearts and Conſciences to condemn them, until God himſelf doth: which certainly without repentance, he will; and that out of their own conſciences and mouths; their conſciences which witneſs, that theſe are the true cauſes of their negligence and contempt of their Duty in their proper ſtations; and their mouths and profeſſions, in that they pretend obedience, and are much offended at the diſobedience of <hi>Puritans;</hi> as if God and the Church would be ſufficiently ſatisfied with their Anger againſt them, while they themſelves regard it no farther than is for their turn.</p>
                  <p>Two vulgar apologies I ſhall here take notice of, only: For as for that which is alſo commonly ſaid, that evil times hinder them from their duty, I ſhall ſay no more but humbly adviſe them to deal ſincerely with God and their own conſciences in ſuch caſes, and examine themſelves, whether that be the only cauſe: The firſt of theſe is Cuſtom, which hath made the Laws and Canons more favourable: And what is this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom? A direct violation of the Laws of the Church and Orders and Precepts of it; and then a bold reply to an objecter of this to them: <hi>It is not kept, i. e.</hi> They do not keep themſelves to ſuch preſcriptions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought not; and therefore it is as well as it is: For cuſtom, what is it they mean by it? If a Cuſtom of an hundred years hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed a Law, a Cuſtom of one year, when it lets in the ſaid Graces of Idleneſs, eaſe, and profit, ſhall preſcribe and prevail againſt it: If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perſons backed by Laws have done, or not done ſuch things; and one or two indulgers to themſelves, have tranſgreſſed on the contrary, theſe are the Preſidents we chooſe for us; theſe we alledg for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe, This is that we call a Cuſtom; and ſoon by the flattery and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the foreſaid vertues, will the infection ſpread, and the party become ſo numerous, ſtrong and bold, as to condemn thoſe who make doubt of being <hi>Cuſtomed</hi> by them; and to deride them as <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Conformiſts to the Canons and Laws of the Church: So that without ſome ſtop and fence againſt this encroaching and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring miſchief, all things will be ſum'd up briefly into theſe two things: Firſt, that there be a Cuſtom to make Laws and Rules for the modelling of the Church, and regulating the worſhip of God therein: And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

far greater and more prevalent cuſtome, that none of them ſhould be kept which agrees not with the conſcience of the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the convenience of the Church Party themſelves, as well Rulers as obeyers.</p>

Now if a man be ſoundly ſatisfied in his conſcience, firſt that the Law it ſelf would, if it could ſpeak, acknowledg the reaſon to be good, of not keeping to the letter of it, then a diſpenſation would ſtand him in good ſtead, in ſecuring him from the penalties belonging to the ſame: But if men look no farther than that which is leaſt conſiderable in Diſpenſations, and meerly accidental, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſaving themſelves harmleſs, under the breach of it; they are notoriouſly deceived in the vertue of them: For, no diſpenſation can avail any man, which doth not make the thing juſt and reaſonable to be done, or not done: I ſhall give but one inſtance of this error, and the Evil of procuring diſpenſations (whereas they

It is plain, that before diſtinction of days ſet apart in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to the praiſe of God, which we now call <hi>Holidayes,</hi> there was a daily publick worſhip ſolemnly uſed by the Church, and Chriſtians held themſelves bound to be preſent at the ſame. For <hi>Origen</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus,</hi> affirms, That to Chriſtians every day was an Holiday and Feſtival. And to<note place="margin">Chryſ. To. 5. Serin. 88. p. 602, 603.</note> the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in whoſe age the ſpecial Memory of Saints was frequent, ſaith, that <hi>Every day is a Feaſt to a Chriſtian.</hi> And out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and others, it is manifeſt that there was wont to have been a daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by Chriſtians of the Euchariſt. But this ſo ſolemn and conſtant attendance on Gods worſhip, ill agreeing with mens daily civil imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it was the wiſdom and piety of the Church, to reſtrain the more ſolemn Service of God to ſome ſpecial days, which was ſignalized with the memory of Chriſt, or his eminent Servants and Saints. So that if Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries would but keep to the grounds of Chriſtianity, rather than natural Policie and Intereſt, they might find the contrary to that Calumny againſt the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> That it reſtrains men in their callings. For the Church hath rather made a Relaxation and Indulgence to men in order to their worldly affairs, than laid any new reſtraints upon them, in that it hath much leſſened the number of Feſtivals, to what they were twelve or thirteen hundred years ago, and much more in the later days of the Roman Church. It is a groſs and prophane Errour of modern Sectaries, to imagine that there is no obligation upon Chriſtian people, to repair to the houſe of God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, whether to publick or private Devotion, as we have ſaid before: but much greater, to imagine that the obligation is not yet ſtronger, when the Authority of the Church determines the time and place, though there be no Sermon, there to offer their Prayers unto God, and be inſtructed and edified out of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>But I hold it beſt (conſidering the many prejudices and ſuperſtitious ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that are bred in the minds of too many ſimple Chriſtians, concerning the uſe of Gods houſe and the worſhip therein) to propound, what might more accurately be ſpoken of that ſubject from the opinion of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that devout and judicious Father, in an Homily againſt ſuch as abſented themſelves too much from the Houſe of God, in theſe words, ſo near as I

But this Houſe is clear from all theſe. Wherefore, they are the Tents of wicked men; but this the Houſe of God. And as the ſhore, free from winds and waves, affords great ſafety to the Barks which put into them: In like manner the Houſe of God, drawing ſuch as enter into it from the ſtroms of outward buſineſses, cauſeth them to abide in great calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſecurity, and to hear the Oracles of God.

Would ye know where ſuch perſons ſpend their time, who deſpiſe the Congregation, what witholds them, and what withdraws them from this ſacred Table, and of what is there diſcourſed: Or rather I know clearly: For rather they prate of abſurd and ridicuious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or are fix'd on worldly cares. But both theſe exerciſes fail of pardon, and have extream puniſhment. And for the former, there is no need ſo much as of a word or demonſtration. Yea, that they who pretend the affairs of their houſe, and alledge the unſupportable neceſſity from thence, can by no means obtain pardon, being called once aweek, and even not then enduring the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Spiritual before Earthly things, is apparent from the Goſpels. For they who were called to the ſpiritual Marriage, made ſuch excuſes as theſe: One, that he had bought a yoke of Oxen; one, that he had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a field; another, that he had married a bride: but they were all alike puniſhed. They may be neceſſary cauſes, but when God calls, they are no Apology: For after God, all things are neceſſary: After his honour, let all other things be regarded.

according to every Feſtival aſſembly. For though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuntide is paſſed, yet the Feaſt is not over: For every coming together is a Feaſt. Whence doth this appear? From the very words of Chriſt himſelf,</hi>

But when Chriſt is in the midſt of them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, what other proof of a Feaſt would ye have greater than this? Where there is teaching and praying, where are the Benedictions of the Fathers, the hearing of Laws, where the aſſembling of Brethren is, and the bond of ſincere Charity, where there is converſing with God, and God diſcourſes with men, why ſhould we not call that a Feaſt and Solemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> &amp;c. Thus he. And are not all theſe to be had many dayes, even when there is no Sermon? And have not men been of late taught to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, and prophanely deride ſuch incomparable daily bleſſings as theſe, and the benefits flowing from them; the more is the ſhame, and the more is the pity. God of his great mercy and grace teach us better, and better ſettle us and incline us: delivering us from that prophane impoſture, which hath of late been wrought into the minds of Chriſtians moſt unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly, that it is needleſs, nay perhaps worſe, ſuperſtitious, in publick or private manner to viſit Gods Houſe by Prayers and Praiſes offered there to him, but when a Sermon is at hand.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Precept of the Church is to all conſcientious Chriſtians, and obedient Children of God and the Church, <hi>To obſerve the Faſts of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Directions after the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar and Rubrick after the Nicene Creed.</note> 
                     <hi>the Church:</hi> which Faſts the Church makes fourfold: The Fourty Days of Lent: Ember Days at the four Seaſons, being the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday after the firſt Sunday in Lent; after the Feaſt of Pentecoſt; after <hi>September</hi> the Fourteenth; and after <hi>December</hi> the Thirteenth: The Three Rogation days, being the Monday, Tueſday, and Wedneſday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Holy Thurſday, or the Aſcenſion of our Lord. In all which we muſt note and ſuppoſe that Faſting it ſelf in general is the Ordinance of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not of the Church: this duty in a manner contrary unto that of rejoycing unto God and Feaſting, ſtanding upon the ſame Grounds that Feſtivals and Days of Thankſgiving to God, do. For firſt, it ſeems to be ſo far natural to man as Religion it ſelf is; All people, that worſhip a God, having generally their viciſſitudes of Feaſting and Faſting, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to occaſions juſtly offered, or the prudence of the firſt Founders and Adminiſtratours of that Religion. Again, By the Precepts and Precedents contained in the Scriptures, is Faſting required ſo that no inſtances are needful to confirm the ſame. And the true reaſon why the Precepts po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in the Old Teſtament are but few, is becauſe it was agreeable to the Law of Nature, that it was not ſo needful to add multitude of poſitive Injunctions to confirm the ſame. The moſt expreſs, if not only Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concerning this in the Scriptures, is that of <hi>Leviticus</hi> the <hi>16th, verſ.</hi> 29. where God ordains that on the Seventh Moneth they ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their ſouls for ever, by a perpetual ſtatute; but in what manner is not expreſſed, whether by abſtaining from all meat, or their ordinary dyet, is not mentioned, but the Tradition and Cuſtom of the Jewiſh Church interpret it to be total Abſtinence, until the Evening; that is, the Sun going down. And the reaſon why no expreſs Precept is given in the Goſpel to Faſt, where many Directions and Rules are given to Faſt is, becauſe, To Faſt was a ſetled practiſe of old in the Church of God, and needed nothing more then the accommodation thereof to the future ſtate of the Goſpel, which was done partly by the ſaid Advices and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:55232:263"/>
Inſtructions how to Faſt, and partly by the power and prudence of the Governours of the Church, extending to ſuch ends.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay againſt this, That Faſting muſt be voluntary, and not of conſtraint and neceſſity, and therefore muſt not Authority impoſe ſuch duties upon Chriſtians, but they muſt take them up freely, or omit them, according to their Chriſtian Liberty. But this miſerable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious exception they are forced to recal again, though they would not be ſeen in it, to ſave themſelves; who being in Power, however acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, propoſe and impoſe both Faſts and Feaſts at their pleaſures: ſo that they plainly mean, That ſuch Faſts are only to be enjoyned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who cannot (as all others commanding contrary to them) poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly injure Chriſtians in their Liberty: For ſo ſaith <hi>Thomas Cartwright,</hi> mocking St. <hi>Paul, We cannot do any thing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> But farther, we ſay, Not only all Faſtings, but Prayer and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, yea all Moral Vertues, as Juſtice and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ought to be freely taken up of every good Chriſtian: but doth it therefore follow, they may not be enjoyned? Or laſtly, doth it follow, that what is commanded and conditionally neceſſary, may not be freely choſen, if not according to the utmoſt extent of liberty of will accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Philoſophy, yet according to the Divine and Scriptural ſenſe, in which whatſoever is done readily, chearfully, and willingly in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, is accepted of God, who loveth a chearful giver, as the<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7.</note> Scripture affirms, not taking notice whether there be any incumbent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or not, upon the perſon. And may not, what St. <hi>Peter</hi> adviſes and exhorts the Elders and Governours of the Church to, <hi>viz. To feed the Flock of Chriſt among them, taking the overſight thereof not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but willingly,</hi> concern the governed equally? May not there be a<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> conſtraint upon theſe, as well as on them in their Ranks, conſiſting with a laudable willingneſs? Nay more than ſo, and quite contrary to the Divinity of factious Paſtours and Flocks, ſhould the laudableneſs of the thing it ſelf, fortified and enforced with the Commands of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, make men that have any juſt pretences to Chriſtianity, more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and chearful in the performance of thoſe duties? This was ever wont to be ſo, until peſtilent tongues had corrupted the minds and hearts of ſimpler Chriſtians to make them ſuſpect, hate, and oppoſe whatever their Governours ordained, and then to argue, <hi>They can by no mean do ſo, becauſe they do not like it, and this diſlikes their Conſciences.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Do all things without murmuring or diſputings:</hi> theſe modern Doctours ſay,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Do nothing without murmurings and diſputings.</hi> Let therefore this be one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and qualification to Faſting, that it be done willingly, and the rather becauſe it is required.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon is to excite to humiliation, and to quicken our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in Prayers and Repentance, while we judge our ſelves unworthy of Gods common benefits otherwiſe appointed. But not to excurr here on this ſubject, as I might: Let it ſuffice to relate here both the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Grounds of Faſting, as we find them in our Churches Homilies.<note place="margin">Homilies Church of <hi>England,</hi> 2. Part. p. 85. &amp; 78.</note> 
                     <hi>Faſting is a witholding of meat and drink and all natural food from the body, for the determinate time of Faſting.</hi> Again, <hi>There are three ends of Faſting: 1. Chaſtizing the Fleſh. 2. Fervencie of Spirit. 3. Sign of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <pb n="486" facs="tcp:55232:264"/>But idle and ignorant perſons give the ſame definition to Faſting as they do to Repentance. For to abſtain from ſin, is both Faſting and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: not conſidering, as we have before ſhewed, how that things, when the end and effect of them is highly commended and magnified, are vulgarly deſcribed by them, yet remain in nature altogether diſtinct: as in that remarkable place of <hi>Syracides, He that keepeth the Law bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 35, 1, 2</note> 
                     <hi>offerings enough: he that taketh heed to the commandment, offereth a Peace-offering. He that requiteth a good turn, offereth fine flour: and he that giveth alms, ſacrificeth praiſe.</hi> Were not he (think we) an excellent Interpreter that ſhould take theſe expreſſions in the ſtricteſt ſenſe they are delivered? And is not he the very ſame that ſhall define either Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Faſting by abſtinence from ſin, in a proper ſenſe, as all definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Hom. 84. To. 5. &amp; Tom. 1. Hom. 8.</note> ought to be framed in? St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who in a certain Sermon ſpeaks as much as any, in behalf of abſtinence from ſin, as a Faſt truly acceptable to God, was never ſo mad or ſilly as to exclude thereupon outward and bodily Faſting: but in very many Sermons of his upon <hi>Geneſis</hi> (which were delivered in the time of Lent, as were St. <hi>Baſils</hi> alſo upon the Six days work of God) nothing occurs more frequently then that literal and outward Faſting commended to his hearers. Infinite might be the citations to prove the Judgment of the holy Fathers and Martyrs, and Monks in this particular: but it is confeſſed by diſſenters, who know any thing above the Divinity of <hi>Urſin</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſuch like unhappy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Errours in this point.</p>
                  <p>And what are the other principal reaſons againſt ſuch Faſtings as our Church, by vertue of Canonical obedience, injoyns? Why, A ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſcrimination of Meats, as if ſome were cleaner than other, under the Goſpel. This they would needs bring it to, becauſe they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without this, which is juſt nothing. For they ſay, out of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all that thou haſt to do,</hi> Therefore <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 3.</note> muſt thou not keep any Holy-day to Gods Service but Sunday: So ſay they, God hath created all Meats to be received with Thankſgiving, Therefore you muſt not abſtain from them. Indeed, one place excellently well interprets the other: For juſt as God hath ſaid <hi>Six days ſhalt thou work;</hi> ſo hath he ſaid, <hi>All Meats ſhall be eaten under the Goſpel.</hi> And as it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful under that ſuppoſed command, to reſt on any of the Six days from labour, ſo is it unlawful under the Goſpel to faſt or abſtain from meat any one day. How can, or dare any man, if ſuch arguing as this will hold good, ceaſe any one day from eating and drinking, if it be a command that we muſt eat and drink all meats now, not hurtful to our bodies, and that without any exception or limitation of time? Do not they much more offend againſt Chriſtian liberty and Gods command, who will not eat at all, thoſe creatures that God hath commanded or ſanctified to our uſe, by his Word, than they who eat ſome ſort of Gods good creatures, but omit others? But undoubtedly God never intended to enact a formal Law, or give a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that the one or other ſhould be done, but to grant a liberty and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſo to do: Now no Indulgences are Commands, nor being not accepted generally, offend the Donor. God in the Decalogue had choſen one day to himſelf; and for the ſix remaining, left them free to do that which he forbad to do on the Seventh: And this is all that is meant by <hi>Thou ſhalt labor ſix days:</hi> God under the Goſpel, hath taken of the diſtinction of meats clean and unclean le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally; and freely pronounces us at liberty to eat what of them we pleaſe: for none of them can hurt or defile us <hi>naturally,</hi> as the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> held; nor any

And ſo fiſh is as clean, and as much Gods creature as fleſh, and fleſh as fiſh. Have they heard of any ſo blockiſh as to deny it of late dayes?

But the Weſtern Church, through favour and indulgence, hath for many Ages permitted the uſe of fiſh to all obedient Sons; as alſo of wine, at ſuch times as her Faſts are obſerved. It is therefore a great miſtake in her Enemies and Accuſers, to judge her of rigour in limiting Chriſtians to ſuch ſort of Meats, as are now allowed. For it was rather her act of Grace and Lenity to remit the one half of that ancient Severity commonly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto in the earlier days of Chriſtian Religion. And who but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ill natur'd and nurtur'd children, could turn her Lenity into Tyranny, and make her curteſie a matter of calumny? Nay, (which hath more diſingenuity and abſurdity) while they fret and complain grievouſly that the Yoke, as it is, lyes too heavy upon them, and preſſes them too hard, to invert their ſpite and malice againſt it, by arguing from the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and contemptibleneſs of ſuch Faſtings, as conſiſts only in abſtinence from fleſh: ſaying, It is no Faſt which abſtains not abſolutely from all Meat. This were indeed ſomewhat to the purpoſe, if ſo be that the Church did at the ſame time command any man to eat fiſh, or ſo much as hearbs or bread, when ſhe forbids fleſh to be eaten: Or that they, who were able and did wholly abſtain from Meats at ſuch ſeaſons, did not more fulfill the intention of the Church, then they who took the liberty left them of eating in ſome manner.

that the Faſtings of our Church tend only to the encreaſe of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or are intended for the good of beaſts, not of men. But what hinders that the Church may have one end in her decrees, and the Common-wealth another? and that which the Church deſigned for the exerciſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vertues, may be embraced by Secular Politicians, to promote Secular benefits to the Publick? Nothing is ſo manifeſt to him that knows any thing in Church Hiſtory, as that ſuch a reaſon was never dreamt of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of ſuch Faſtings in our Church, nor in any part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world before that Act. And if the words of that Act were intended for an eaſe to the tender Conſciences (as thoſe of diſſenters are miſ-called) and to draw them by little and little, upon conſideration of Civil ends, (which they leſs hated than the Eccleſiaſtical) to ſome good order and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; this is not to be drawn to a perpetual Rule, nor made the only univerſal end of ſuch a Conſtitution: For the Church ſtill keeps to the moſt ancient and general ſenſe received amongſt Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A Law</hi> then (to begin with the Definition) ſeems to be nothing elſe, but <hi>The rational and juſt will of a Soveraign Power, declared and manifeſted to its Subjects, for the better informing, directing, and regulating them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truth and juſtice.</hi> This Deſcription, though I find not entirely and abſolutely in others, yet is found in its ſeveral parts of which it conſiſteth, in divers Authours: and comprehends not only Humane, but Divine Laws, equally; and not only written, but unwritten alſo: For it were a very fond and weak imagination in a man to conceive that the Writing, Printing, or Graving in Stone (as the Ten Commandments are ſaid to be) can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing toward the force and due vigour of a Law, any further
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:55232:266"/>
than that thereby it becomes better known to all therein concerned. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation indeed is eſſential to all Laws, but the Promulgation or Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the foreſaid means, is not ſo: but any other notice given thereof may ſuffice. But while a thing lyes hid in the mind and breaſt only of the proper Legiſlatours or Governours, it cannot, in reaſon, obtain the nature or force of a Law: but then only it doth, when it either is known, or might, and ought to be known, according to the manner of publication. And this <hi>declared will</hi> muſt not be the act of any inferiour or ſubordinate perſon, who of himſelf hath no right to will or require the obſervation of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates or Orders, but of the Supream, originally at leaſt, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. The univerſal and abſolute Soveraign of all things is God alone: and his Power alone, and right of Dominion (of which we have ſpoken in the beginning) abundantly ſuffices to juſtifie all demands of ſervice and obedience from his Creatures, and that according to his abſolute will, without any exception or limitation; it being intrinſecally good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall appear to be the Will of God, even becauſe it is the Will of God, who is nothing but Goodneſs in the moſt abſolute ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is that notwithſtanding Laws are divided into <hi>Divine, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical:</hi> yet in truth, and upon due ſearch, it will be found that they all are Divine really, though not formally, and mediately, though not immediately: as <hi>Tully</hi> excellently, and little leſs than divinely, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,<note place="margin">

A ſecond thing is taken from the <hi>matter</hi> and nature of the Law it ſelf, which, if it be not juſt and reaſonable, bindeth not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though enacted by Authority altogether lawful and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The reaſon whereof is that ſo often abuſed place of holy Writ, which adviſeth to <hi>obey God rather then men.</hi> Gods eternal and indiſpenſable Law<note place="margin">Acts 5. 29.</note> exacteth of man due obſervation, and that chiefly upon account of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Soveraignty and Dominion, which no inferiour Power ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, or can make void. But ſhould any mortal man command contrary of God, it could ſignifie nothing more then the folly of his own heart, and the diſtemper of his mind, and a foul revolt and defection in him that ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be ſo abuſed. But is there no difference (think we) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Powers on earth acting quite contrary to God, and ſuch as only want <hi>ſpecial</hi> warrant for what they ſometimes expect from their Subjects? The ignorance or wilful negligence of this diſtinction or notion is it which hath hurried men into ſo many unchriſtian acts, and made ſuch havock, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Religion. A third principal ingredient into a Law is that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Perſons to whom it is made: not that they muſt owe obedience unto the Lawgiver (thought that be true) for this is the very ſame with the firſt: For wherever there is the firſt part of the Relation, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the ſecond: and ſo, wherever there is Power and juſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to command and rule, there muſt neceſſarily be a duty of obedience in others: but knowledge and manifeſtation of a Law (before touched) is abſolutely requiſite to bind people to the obſervation of it. And yet I mean not actual and inevitable knowledge, but poſſible, and ordinarily attainable: it being moſt certain, that the ſame perſons who ſtand general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to obſerve a Law made and propounded, are likewiſe bound to take notice of its promulgation: and this neglecting, ſubject themſelves to the like penalties as the wilful Violators of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="493" facs="tcp:55232:267"/>There may well be added unto theſe three, a Fourth Condition to the validity of a Law, and that is <hi>Power.</hi> How Power and Authority differ is not unknown, <hi>viz.</hi> that the firſt conſiſts in ſufficient ſtrength and force to conſtrain obedience, or inflict the puniſhment denounced againſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not neceſſarily inferring Right ſo to do: And this is not intrinſecal to a Law, becauſe it is only to be exerciſed as a neceſſary inſtrument, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the ends of Right and Juſtice preceeding, which is Authority properly ſo called; which duly exerciſed, doth oblige without force to ſubmiſſion, and that out of Duty and Conſcience, as appeareth from what we have ſaid already in the Firſt Book of the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe. Now though this Power be not intrinſecal to the <hi>Obligation</hi> of a Law, as ſome unnatural Philoſophers have of late days imagined, and boldly and baſely endeavoured to maintain, yet may it be eſſential to the <hi>Execution</hi> of the ſame; Men being generally ſo unreaſonable and averſe to Order and Government, and the publick Good, when no ſpecial and immediate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage accrues to their particular perſon, that without the iron rod to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, the Majeſty of the Scepter will not ſway them: And but that I have found ſuch prodigious tenets in the writings of late Politicians, denying all Juſtice and Conſcience, and deſtroying them as far as their blind and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wits will enable them (which certainly they never ſhall, any more than to deſtroy God himſelf, and extinguiſh the notion of a Deity out of the minds of men) I ſhould have thought that for want of ſuch a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> of a Law, they fell into ſuch flat and portentous errours: For what doth argue greater ſtupidity, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is no neceſſity (of violence) this ſhould be done, therefore it ought not to be done? Or becauſe that man is impious, who, becauſe he is ſtrong enough to be ſucceſsful, ſcruples not at all to invade and prey on another: and he may become ridiculous that commandeth without any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or probability of effecting what he requireth; therefore no obligation lyes on the perſons to whom he directs himſelf to obey. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed<note place="margin">Ariſt. Politic. l. 3. c. 4. §. 78.</note> tells us of a Law that the Hares ſhould make in their ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that all beaſts ſhould ſhare alike in the earth, but at this (ſaid <hi>Antis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes</hi>) the Lyons laughed: and well they might, when ſuch Laws proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, who had neither Right to make, nor Power to enforce them; but where there is Right without Might, the matter is more to be abhorred on the one ſide, than decided on the other.</p>
                  <p>True it is that <hi>Marſilius Patavinus</hi> does make Coaction an ingredient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Lex propriè ſumpta, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum eſt, de fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endis aut omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendis humanis actibus, ſub poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na tranſgreſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus infligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. <hi>Marſilius Patavinus de Juriſdictione Matrimoniali</hi>

                  <p>And this being not unduly, as we hope, premiſed, we now proceed to the explication of that particular Law of God, called the <hi>Decalogue:</hi> which though it branches it ſelf into ten parts, yet, according to the Jews not amiſs conceiving, is but One Law, as proceeding from one Fountain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in one breath, ſay they, engraven or written as one Line or Word on two Tables, and hanging all on one ſtring, <hi>Charity:</hi> which (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) is the fulfilling of the Law, as many Beads or Jewels make but one Bracelet.</p>

But whether theſe do not concern rather the whole Body of the Law, than the Decalogue in particular, may juſtly be doubted, but ſhall not here be diſputed: though upon this account it may ſeem to concern this alſo: For if the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> be the ſum of the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly taught, how can it ſo be, unleſs it vertually comprehends the ſeveral diſtinct parts thereof? which will be farther cleared in the brief conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe three Particulars concerning the Decalogue. 1. The Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Law. 2. The Nature or Uſe of it: and Thirdly, The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it.</p>
                  <p>The Authour and Inſtitutour of this Law was inſallibly God himſelf, as of all the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, Evangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> received amongſt us for Canonical: But whether there were any more immediate act of God, and, as I may ſay, perſonal, in delivering theſe Commands, than in communicating his will by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites upon other occaſions, is not ſo well reſolved. The Learned of the Jewiſh Doctours do put a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the Divineneſs of the Pentateuch wrote by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt of holy Scripture of the Old Teſtament, making that the Ground and Rule, as it were, of other prophetical Writings: and ſo do many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Law to be more Sacred than the other parts of Scripture; and to be more Sacred, becauſe more ſolemnly and formidably, and with greater manifeſtation of Gods Glory and Majeſty delivered to <hi>Moſes;</hi> yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe written with the finger of God himſelf, as the Scripture witneſſes: which ſeems to ſpeak as if God herein had not uſed the miniſtery of Angels, as at other times, and upon other occaſions, but ſpake and acted immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his own perſon. <hi>Theſe words</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy) the Lord</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>ſpake unto all your aſſembly in the Mount, out of the midſt of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkneſs, with a great voice, and he added no more, and he wrote them in two Tables of Stone, and deliveted them to me.</hi> And when the people in <hi>Exodus</hi> beg of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Speak thou with us and we will</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>hear thee, but let not God ſpeak with us leaſt we dye:</hi> it ſeems to imply that God himſelf was the ſpeaker. Nay, God ſaith afterward, <hi>Ye have ſeen that</hi>

                     <hi>I have talked with you from heaven:</hi> And to this effect the holy Scripture elſewhere, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 36. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 11. from all which there is nothing more certain then that the voice was ſenſible, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humane manner audible; contrary to ſome Jews, who, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> tells us, preſume to ſay, it was imaginary only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="495" facs="tcp:55232:268"/>And what do not the Jews ſuperſtitiouſly deviſe to magnifie this Law, and by implication, themſelves above other people, ſo favoured by God? For they not only ſay, that God, with his own mouth, ſpake theſe <hi>Ten Words,</hi> but with his own hands made the two Tables, as may be ſeen in <hi>Buxtorf:</hi> and<note place="margin">Buxtorf. de Decalogo.</note> amongſt others, <hi>Rabbi Simeon</hi> writes, That <hi>both Tables were created by God immediately, and that before the world began,</hi> not regarding how contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scriptures ſuch an aſſertion is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 1, 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 1. which they would underſtand only of the <hi>Second Tables,</hi> but without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider firſt, how dubiouſly and ambiguouſly the word, <hi>God,</hi> is uſed in Scripture, ſignifying <hi>Angels</hi> often, and ſometimes <hi>Men</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown and Command; and the <hi>Finger of God,</hi> to be the ſame ſometimes with the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> ſometimes with the <hi>Power of God, Exod.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20. And ſecondly, That then, according to our apprehenſion and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures phraſe, God is ſaid to do a thing himſelf, when he doth it, not by any humane inſtrument or help, though he imployeth inviſible Spirits therein, there will be no ſuch neceſſity of Conſequence as may ſeem at firſt view: and thus <hi>Calvin</hi> upon theſe words of <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. interprets the matter, not amiſs.</p>
                  <p>And if we conſider, ſecondly, what ſenſe the Writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment take them in, the other opinion which holds that theſe Commands were delivered by the mediation of Angels, will appear moſt probable: For ſo ſaith St. <hi>Stephen</hi> expreſly in the <hi>Acts,</hi> to the Jews; <hi>Who received the Law by</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7. 53. Gal. 3. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>the diſpoſition of Angels, and have not kept it.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul, It was ordained by Angels in the hands of a Mediatour.</hi> And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> it is called, <hi>The word ſpoken by Angels.</hi> Some may ſay here, That by <hi>Law</hi> is here to be underſtood, not the <hi>Decalogue</hi> only, but the whole Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> at the leaſt: which cannot be abſolutely denyed, though the contrary ſeems moſt probable: But if it be ſo, does not the whole include the parts? If the Law in general was ſo diſpenced, does it not follow that this Law in particular was ſo ordained? Though if it be granted that this Law parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly was ſo delivered, it doth not follow that the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo given by the miniſtery of Angels, and not only by Divine inſpiration, without any Angels officiating towards it, as in this Caſe we ſuppoſe. And <hi>Perkins</hi> on the <hi>Galatians</hi> affirmeth directly, that this Law was given by the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Perkins</hi> Gal. 3. 19.</note> miniſtery of Angels.</p>
                  <p>And to confirm this, I ſhall adde a Scholaſtical Reaſon: For if it be true what St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi> and what the<note place="margin">John 1. 18.</note> Schools teach (as I believe) that fleſhly eyes cannot poſſibly diſcern God immediately; may we not much more truly ſay, that we cannot hear Gods voice with our fleſhly ears and live, any more than ſee God and live? But God ſays expreſly, <hi>No man ſhall ſee me and live.</hi> But as God maketh cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 20.</note> repreſentations of himſelf to our eye, which are not himſelf, but yet bear his name in Scripture, ſo God produceth, or cauſeth to be produced, audible ſounds, which are not really and properly his voice, yet repreſent ſo much to the ear of man; which when it comes attended with more than natural, or ordinary circumſtances (as did the voice at the giving of the Law) it is more eſpecially and ſignally aſcribed unto God as his.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is ſaid in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that <hi>Moſes wrote upon the Tables the words of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 34 28.</note> 
                     <hi>the Covenant, the Ten Commandments,</hi> which in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God is ſaid to write, <hi>I will write upon theſe Tables the words that were</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>in the firſt,</hi> &amp;c. which moved the Fathers, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom <hi>Lyra</hi>
                     <pb n="496" facs="tcp:55232:269"/>
follows, to underſtand them ſo that God wrote <hi>Autoritatively,</hi> and <hi>Moſes Miniſterially.</hi> But later Jewiſh and Chriſtian Expoſitours have thought good rather to refer the later part of theſe words, <hi>And he was there with the Lord fourty dayes and fourty nights, he did neither eat bread nor drink water: and he wrote upon the Tables the words of the Covenant, the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> to God, not without ſome violence to the ſenſe, more current otherwiſe: But in ſuch variety and obſcurity as is here, I ſee no remedy but men muſt judge for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>However, I ſuppoſe the ſecond thing propounded, is from hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently clear, concerning the Nature of this Law: That as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Divine, ſo from the Authority delivering it, it hath no more force or obligation upon us, than other words of God extant in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor is it eaſily to be conceived, how any thing can be ſaid to be more or leſs divine, which is acknowledged to come from God, by vertue of any manner of delivering it, whether mediately or immediately, by a ſtill and quiet inſpiration, or by a publick and majeſtick declaration; but from the matter it may: And <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his forementioned Tractate on<note place="margin">Buxtorf. in Decalog. num. 51. <hi>Priſcis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> the Decalogue hath theſe words; <hi>In ancient times it was a cuſtome among the Jews, that the Decalogue ſhould every day in the Morning Prayers be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and privately rehearſed and repeated</hi>—<hi>This laudable cuſtom, in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, they have aboliſhed: the reaſon whereof the Talmud renders to be, leſt the people ſhould believe that the Decalogue had any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore divineneſs in it than other parts of Scripture.</hi> From whence we may obſerve, Firſt, That anciently the Jews had a conſtant Form of Worſhip. Secondly, That there is no ſuch ridiculouſneſs in Prayers publick and private, to repeat the Creed and Ten Commandments, as certain pretenders to giftedneſs have preſumed. Thirdly, That the Jewiſh Doctours diſcerning the great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that might happen from admitting degrees of Sacredneſs in Divine Revelations, choſe to prevent ſuch errours, by taking away the preſumed occaſion: For however ſome have diſtinguiſhed between Divine Right and Apoſtolical, making this a mean between humane purely, and divine; yet in propriety of ſpeech all Conſtitutions are either divine purely, or pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane. And therefore Apoſtolical Right can be no more than humane Right, when it is diſtinguiſhed from Divine.</p>
                  <p>This we ſpeak of Conſtitutions taken in their formality, not as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are uſed, for the things themſelves ſo ordained. For no doubt but as there are degrees of ſins againſt Laws, ſo theſe degrees are eſtimated from the weightineſs or lightneſs of the matter againſt which offences are committed. And thus we may hold that the Ten Commandments are more Sacred, that is, contain more important matters than generally the reſt of the Scriptures do, that is again, in the like number words, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt perfect and plain, and compendious form of ſerving God that the Jews had any where revealed unto them, if not a more abſolute ſum of our practical duties towards God and Man, then we find collected together in ſo few words in the Goſpel; and therefore not unworthily inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Second part of the Office of our Church.</p>
                  <p>But whether this <hi>Decalogue</hi> was ever intended by God, as ſuch a perfect and compleat Rule of Obedience, that nothing to which Jew or Chriſtian was obliged, hath eſcaped it, may well be queſtion'd: underſtanding the Queſtion not ſo much of ceremonial or extrinſecal Duties of Religion, as moral and perpetual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="497" facs="tcp:55232:269"/>Many have this laſt age brought forth, who though they look upon it lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than ridiculous to make any uſe of the Ten Commandments in our worſhip of God, yet aſcribe ſo great perfection to it as a Rule, that they ſuppoſe they have convinced you of abſurdity enough, if they drive you to either of theſe ſtraits, To deny any Moral duty to be contained in the Decalogue, or to affirm any Ceremonial to be therein included: For then they loudly cry concerning the Firſt, you make the Law of God an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule: And concerning the Second, (as by name doth Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> in his Treatiſe on the Sabbath, with innumerable others) If, for inſtance, the Fourth Commandment be not Moral, what doth it among the Ten Commands? And having ſaid this, they need (they think) ſay no more, to confound their adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>To the former therefore we ſay that improving the Art of Reduction to the height, no doubt but all Moral and Ceremonial duties too, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſome of the Ten Commandments. For if our Saviour Chriſt our Great and Infallible Maſter reduced theſe Ten to two: and again, all things contained in the Law and Prophets (which muſt be all Moral duties) to Love of God and Love of our Neighbour, in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>On theſe two Commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets:</hi> Nay, and<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 37, 38, 39, 40.</note> which is yet more, St. <hi>Paul</hi> brings all Chriſtian duties under one Head of Love, ſaying, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Do we wonder at, or can<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> we cenſure thoſe who would have all Chriſtian vertues included, and vices and ſins excluded by the Decalogue? But ſurely, they who contend for ſuch a comprehenſion as may be uſeful to a man, do not intend that it ſelf ſhould be incomprehenſible and illimited; which at this rate, it muſt be, reducing every thing to any thing: but certain Rules have been invented for the limiting and directing of men in this matter; which being not taken from the Reaſon of the thing it ſelf ſo much, as the Arbitrary wit of the<note place="margin">Hic video quoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in hoc ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boraſſe, ut uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa proecepta ſive jubentia, ſive ventantia ad hoec decem redigant: &amp; Capitalium peccatorum ſpecies quae ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem numeran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, in aliquod horum refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum: ſed ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lâ diligentiâ magis quam ſerid. <hi>Eraſm.

For ſurely, all ſin, as well as Gluttony turns us away from our Laſt End, which is God; and our reſting in him: and therefore, by this reaſon, all ſin ſhould be Sabbath-breaking. St. <hi>James</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 2. 10.</note> indeed ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;</hi> that is, <hi>a breaker of all.</hi> But he very well explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately after, that he meant not ſo much in reſpect of the <hi>matter</hi> of the Law, that a man could not ſin againſt it in one caſe, but he muſt ſin againſt it in another; but in reſpect of the <hi>Manner.</hi> For, ſaith he, <hi>He that ſaid unto thee do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo do not kill,</hi> &amp;c. implying
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:55232:270"/>
thus much, that the ſame evil mind that diſpoſes a man to diſobey God in one point of the Law, will incline him to the like in others: and the Cords of Fear and Love of God being broken, to offend God in one ſin, leave him at liberty to offend him in any other whatever. Not that a man doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or actually commit ſin againſt the whole Law: As in the caſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues, according to Philoſophers, all are ſo connected and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon one another in Prudence, that whoever wants that, lies open to all vices. But our enquiry is concerning the connexion of vertues and vices in the <hi>matter</hi> of them; whether the offender in one ſin, is guilty of all: whether the Drunkard be a Thief, or the Sabbath-breaker an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer: For according to the large extent of Rules commonly given, either of theſe may be made good: and without ſuch a latitude, drunkenneſs will hardly find a proper place in any of the Ten Commandments, unleſs we ſay, as ſome more wittily than ſolidly, <hi>Drunkenneſs ſlaggers through all the Commands:</hi> And in the like ſenſe, What ſin doth not?

A ſecond reaſon might be, for that the Decalogue (as we have already ſaid) though it be not ſuch an exquiſite and ample Rule as to contain all things, without great ſtraining and force, yet it being the moſt ſignificant is any where extant in Scripture, Chriſtians choſe that for their <hi>Compendium:</hi> to which other duties might relate.

And ſo where other particular precepts want the enforcement of them in the concluſion, they may well borrow it from ſome other: as for Example, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> ſet before all the Commandments, ought to have the ſame influence upon all, as upon the firſt: And ſo that in the end of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me, and ſhew mercy unto them that love me and keep my Commandments,</hi> is of force upon all the other Commandments, exacting obedience to each in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, under the like Promiſes upon obedience; and Judgments upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the diviſion or diſpoſition of the Ten Commandments in the Decalogue, becauſe the diſputation about that conduces but little to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the curious enquirer, I ſhall not inſiſt on it; only premiſe a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſuperſtitious adhering to any one Faith in the caſe: For the truth is, It matters not how they are numbred, provided that we looſe not of their number: in which caſe the modern Romaniſts, with great impudence, offend in <hi>expurging</hi> the Decalogue it ſelf, and <hi>expunging</hi> the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Their Apology or Excuſe is no leſs preſumptuous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, and to be had in more deteſtation than the Fact. Better a great deal they had ſo done, and given no reaſon at all, or their Common one, <hi>That we muſt not enquire into the Acts of our Superiours,</hi> and eſpecially of the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to bring ſuch a reaſon as may juſtifie them, or any body elſe in taking away half a douzen more Precepts out of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: For doubtleſs (as hath been ſaid) the vertue of thoſe Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands may be contained in a leſs number than they are: Shall we therefore implicitly, at leaſt, tax Gods Spirit of <hi>tautologie</hi> and ſuperfluity, and mend what it hath unartificially delivered unto us? But it is well they can endure to leave them in their Bibles, as they find them. For ſurely they muſt either deny themſelves or the Reaſons why they leave it out of their Catechiſes and Books of Devotion; that I mean eſpecially which tells us, <hi>It is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Firſt:</hi> though the true reaſon perſwades them otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt the Second Command ſtanding inviolate as God ordained, ſhould be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe and ſtumbling-block to the weak and unlearned: And there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it, ſtanding where they neither muſt nor can come at it, in the Bible.

                     </gap>arther, That it is Ceremonial: Firſt we reply, That it is not ceremonial or proper to the Jews, as ſet down there entirely with its end and qualification, <hi>Bowing down or Worſhipping</hi> any thing repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, whether Image or Statue: and ſo the Eaſtern Churches alwayes did, and ſtill do underſtand it of general and immutable nature, though they be too great admirers of Imagery otherwiſe. Again, if it were ſo peculiar to the Jews, as is vainly pretended, that they were to make no Images to themſelves, is it alſo ſo proper to them (<hi>Quarto modo,</hi> as Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſpeak) that Chriſtians are not capable of it, or muſt not take it in that ſenſe alſo, if they pleaſe? It is granted lawful to Chriſtians in a Civil ſenſe, to uſe Images: but is it not alſo lawful for them to let them alone? Againſt what part of the Decalogue ſhould they offend, yea, what any other part of Old or New Teſtament, if they refuſed to make any Images at all? Time certainly was, and that for Two Centuries together (notwithſtanding ſome fabulous Records to the contrary) when Chriſtians ſcrupuled to make any Image in order to any Religious uſe, though but to call to mind things Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically, or help Devotion: after many Centuries, they never farther u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them than for meditation. And what one Precept of Gods Word would ſuffer by it, if they ſhould have perſevered in that ſimplicity to this day? I am ſure many are violated by the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>limited, or ill limited uſe of them. And now, what danger would the common ſort run into, if ſuch words had been found in their Books of Inſtruction, as the Second Commandment contains? Would they have fallen into Idolatry, the worſt of all ſins next Atheiſm, as by the confeſſion and conceſſion of divers of the ſoberer ſort of Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, they do in the uſe of them? <hi>Auſtin</hi> indeed comprehended the Second Commandment in the Firſt, as they pretend towards their juſtification, but can they ſo much as pretend that he ſo reduced it to that, that he contented himſelf with the words only of the Firſt, and left out, as inſignificant or dangerous, the Second? No ſurely: For it is plain he joyned them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely together: which, if Papiſts had done, they had herein little offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Auguſtinus in Speculo ex <hi>Exodo</hi> initio.</note> us: Yea, ſo far was St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> from ſo doing, that on the contrary, in that Abbreviation he gives us of the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> he leaves out the Firſt, <hi>viz. Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> and begins with this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, nor the likeneſs of any thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For, as I was ſaying, we are not ſuch ſuperſtitious admirers of Numbers or Meaſures in theſe caſes, that we would have contended ſo much as now, if they had made but Two Commandments of the Ten, provided they had given us the Subſtance of them without mutulation: but to make themſelves more jealous for God than he is for himſelf, who here ſtileth himſelf <hi>a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God,</hi> is ſupream folly, and much worſe.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſeems to divide the Commandments into two Parts, when it ſaith, that they were written in two Tables: as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 15. and 34. 1. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. cap. 5. 22. and 10. 1, 4. But this doth not prove that they were ſo diſtinguiſhed as many have imagined, that thoſe duties which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the worſhip of God immediately, ſhould be placed diſtinctly in one Table, and thoſe which more immediately concern our Neighbour, ſhould have another Table for themſelves; as common Painters have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them. For in all probability, what was written Originally by God, was connected together ſo cloſely, that though there were Two Tables to contain all the Commandments, there was no ſuch chaſmes or diſtances left as are to be ſeen in the more modern diſtinction of the Scripture into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:55232:271"/>
Verſes, but as it fell out, ſo the words proceeded from one Table to another, coheringly.</p>
                  <p>The Jews (as may be ſeen in <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi>) divided the Law<note place="margin">Philo Jud. p. 579. Genev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. lib. 3, 4.</note> into two equal Parts, not according to the matter reſpecting God and Man, but the manner or number, and made Five Precepts in One Table, and Five in the other. <hi>Auſtine, Proſper,</hi> and ſuch as follow them, make but Three Precepts in the Firſt Table, and Seven in the Second: But later Ages, not without the conſent and concurrence of ancienter, have from the matter it ſelf, divided the Commandments ſo, that Four which relate principally to God, ſhould be placed in the Firſt Table, and Six in the Second: which ſeems to be moſt rational, though no leſs arbitrary than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>There are likewiſe among the Jews who agree not in the very matter it ſelf of the Ten Commandments: For ſome, as the Talmudiſts, and others following them, do make that we call properly The <hi>Proaem,</hi> or <hi>Preface, I am the Lord thy God,</hi> to be part of the Firſt Commandment, which is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Aberbenel,</hi> and others of them, as well as moſt of us. For this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Sentence, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> is, as we ſay, properly Enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Indicative, or purely affirmative, and not Imperative or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as all Precepts muſt be, which are ſo properly called.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Commandment therefore is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. I.</note> 
                     <hi>but me.</hi> Where it is firſt to be obſerved, that almoſt thorow the whole Decalogue, ſome variety in words is to be found in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and in <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romy</hi> the Fifth, where it is repeated. The Reaſon whereof <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks to be this, That here <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſet down, or rather took preciſely, what was ſpoken or written by the Angel: but in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> he rehearſes the ſame himſelf, without ſuch abſolute Punctualities of words or expreſſions; and yet muſt we not dare to ſay, or believe that <hi>Moſes</hi> tranſgreſſed his own Rule given by God in the Fourth Chapter before, <hi>viz. Ye ſhall not adde unto</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.</hi> So that it is a vain Scholie ſome would give us upon that, and ſuch like Texts of Scripture, that nothing at all muſt be added to Gods word, more than we find the Letter to require. For undoubtedly ſuch ſpeeches mean no more than that we ſhould do or ſay neither more or leſs to overthrow the intention of God in his Commandments. For otherwiſe, all the large and far fetched ſenſes deviſed and applyed by the preciſe Maſters and Miſtakers of that Rule, to each particular Precept in the Decalogue, would be found either Superſtitious or Sacrilegious inventions, though not inconſiſtent with the Analogy of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, Laws are of two ſorts generally, Affirmative or Negative. In the Negative (of which this is one) the ordinary method of explication, is, firſt to declare thoſe ſins of Commiſſion which are prohibited: and then the Duties, Graces, and Vertues which are there implicitly required on the contrary: this being one general Rule of expounding the Decalogue, that where any vice or ſin is forbidden, there the contrary vertue is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And on the other ſide, Where any vertue or holy act is required, there the contrary vice or evil is interdicted. As for Example: Here it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, that we ſhould have, or make, or worſhip any other God but the one true God; therefore on the contrary, there is an implicite injunction duly and faithfully to ſerve that one true God. And though the ſenſe Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is moſt current and general through the whole Decalogue, yet were
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:55232:272"/>
the Affirmative duties they which God principally aimed at and intended. For <hi>Negatives</hi> do not make us holy to God in themſelves, but only as they are neceſſary introductions, and good beginnings to the more perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of <hi>Poſitive</hi> Duties. It would avail a man very little towards the fulfil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght worſhip none at all, and be a greater offender than the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater that worſhips many. We are therefore in the firſt place to enquire what are thoſe Vertues and Graces God commands, and ſo ſhall we more readi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y and eaſily conceive what errours and ſins we are hereby command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid. Some of both ſorts we ſhall here inſtance in, to make more compleat that rude and imperfect account given above of the Acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Holineſs owing from every good Chriſtian to God; but as in a Table, rather than in a Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Suppoſition then that this firſt Precept requires of us the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, doth infer all that train of Graces thereunto neceſſary; which are commonly reduced to theſe three Theological Vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Of the nature of Faith, as well in General as Particular, have we ſpoken largely in the firſt Part: Yet rather in a ſpeculative than practical or obediential way, which is proper to this place.</p>
                  <p>By the duty of Faith then, it is firſt required that we ſhould have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of God and of his will; for ſome knowledge muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity go before Faith: There is a twofold knowledge: One of ſimple apprehenſion or intelligence; and this muſt go before Faith: <hi>For how</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> It is impoſſible a man ſhould worſhip God before he believes there is a God: And impoſſible he ſhould believe there is a God before he hath ſome notion or apprehenſion of a God, either by hearing, which is the ordinary way, or by ſome inward ſuggeſtion: And therefore we read that <hi>Paul</hi> inquiring of the<note place="margin">Acts 19. 2.</note> Novices in Chriſtianity at <hi>Epheſus, Have ye received the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> they anſwered, <hi>We have not as yet heard whether there be an Holy Ghoſt, or no.</hi> And there is another knowledge of Aſſurance; which aſſurance is cauſed in Humane Sciences by an orderly and neceſſary connexion of natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes one with another, but in Divine matters, by Faith: which cauſes that, or greater perſwaſion than any outward artificial Demonſtrations. And therefore, both the encreaſe of our knowledge, and the encreaſe and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Faith, are much required by this Precept; according as we have the Scriptures more particularly adviſing us, and that by St. <hi>Peter:</hi>

Now what are competent notices, is to be judged from the common Rule to other errours, as well as that of Idolatry. And therefore the modern Invention of <hi>Hyperdoulia,</hi> or ſervice above that ordinarily competible to Creatures, is a manifeſt piece of Superſtition, and that Idolatroas; it being not found out yet by the wit of man, to put any mean between Divine worſhip and Civil.

For if it be demanded, What mean you by this <hi>Super-ſervice?</hi> Have they found out, as yet, any other deſcription than that moſt ridiculous of defining a thing by it ſelf; telling us, <hi>Super-ſervice</hi> is that to be given to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> properly: and it being altogether as obſcure, what is that reverence due to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> properly, How ſhould we ſerve or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip her otherwiſe than we do other Saints or Angels? have they at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained themſelves otherwiſe than by this <hi>Hyperdoulia</hi> or <hi>Super-ſervice?</hi> this ſay they, is due to her: but what this is, we are as far to ſeek as at the very firſt: Only we are ſure of this, that by the term it ſelf we may give her moſt properly Divine Worſhip, and be born out by that word. For it manifeſtly implyes ſomewhat exhibited above other Creatures, but nothing at all of the inferiourneſs of that ſervice to that given to God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſee no reaſon to doubt, but this vile invention doth commonly end in Idolatry, and that againſt the firſt Commandment: Let us now proceed to the Second.</p>
                  <p>The Second Precept in the Decalogue is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, nor the likeneſs of any thing,</hi> &amp;c. The true meaning of<note place="margin">§. II.</note> which can have, or need no better expoſition than the general practiſe of the Popiſh Churches: For being reſolved to hold to their corrupt way of making the Image of God, contrary to their Forefathers, who alwayes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred all repreſentation of God, whether by Picture or Statue; and to their groſs ſenſe of giving reverence to that, and others of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, have laid this Precept aſide, as being certainly inwardly convicted that it makes againſt them: as men are apt to turn thoſe Servants or Children out of doors, who will not be kept in good order, or ruled by them; or wicked Subjects who turn their Soveraign out of his Place, his Throne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not rule as they would have him; yet ſtill perhaps will allow him the title of King, under confinement. This Commandment is not by them wholly cancell'd and raſed out of Scripture, but it is kept under reſtraint, leſt it ſhould reduce Chriſtians to its due Obedience. They ſay, It is the ſame in effect with the firſt, and contained in it: If ſo, why they do they not ſuffer it to ſpeak and to bear its part in their Religious Books as well as the other? If it be not, why do they deny it its proper place and uſe? Surely, their reaſon at hand we cannot but accept as good and reaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> It may give offenſe to the people contrary to the uſe of that Church. And why ſo? It it not becauſe their doctrine and practiſe are quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it? Is it not becauſe the native ſenſe of thoſe words is ſo manifeſt and obvious, that they would certainly underſtand them aright, could they be ſuffered to come to the true knowledge of them? And this is the ſcandal and offence would be given them. And in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England,</hi> who opened the Hatches (a little) whereby men were kept in hold from diſcerning the clear light above and about them, when they could no longer conceal the Second Commandment from the people, but it muſt appear in its own entireneſs, in the Engliſh tongue: <hi>Gardiner</hi> and other Romaniſts would have added for ſafety ſake, their own gloſs to the Word

                  <p>But neither of theſe being likely to take effect, a more effectual and bold coarſe is invented and defended, That this Commandment was Ceremonial and Judicial and Temporary; only ordained to prevent the Jews from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Idolatry; to which they were ſo prone. 'Tis true, they were ſo prone <hi>then</hi> to Idolatry; and however they are now-a-dayes more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough averſe from it, yet would they at this day be as prone as ever, were but the liberty given of the uſe of Images, in the ſenſe of the Roman Church: This they have found by experience of their Forefathers, and others of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations; and therefore hold it ſafeſt and beſt to ſet a leſs Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition to keep at a diſtance, a far greater; and to make a ſcruple of all uſe of images (which can ſcarce amount to the nature of ſin at all, though it may of folly) to ſecure themſelves from the contagion of the other extream in the ſuperſtitious uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>It is controverted between the ancient Hebrew Doctours (of which you<note place="margin">Petavius Theolog. Dogmati. To. 4. l. 15. cap. 6. Grotius Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſt. Decal.</note> may read <hi>Petavius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi>) whether Gods intent it was here wholly to deny the Jews the uſe of Images, as <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſuppoſe, or the uſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Divine manner, as others: this later Opinion is choſen by <hi>Petavius</hi> and the Adverſaries to the Iconoclaſts, or Image-breakers. But my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Firſt, That all Jews concur in this, and all Chriſtians, not led by the noſe by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that to make the Image of God at all, under what pretence ſoever, is abſolutely forbidden. And therefore I wonder more at <hi>Gerſon</hi> than at them who lived with, and after him, that he ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to excuſe the Latin Church, thus: <hi>Before the Incarnation, when the Law was given there appeared no Image of the Incorporeal God, either in wood</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gerſon. To. 2. De 10 Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. in Praec. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>or ſtone; becauſe the Image of a Spirit cannot be made: And therefore all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages were then to be rejected: but becauſe that may be now done, ſince the Incarnation of the Son of God, therefore from that time it is allowed to be done by him who might diſpenſe:</hi> Thus he. And how weakly, who may not ſee? Firſt, Why could not the Image of God be made as well before the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as after? And why might not the Image of the Son of God be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Incarnate, therebeing ſome knowledge of the ſame (as we may well ſuppoſe) amongſt the Jews before the Incarnation, and ſome Umbrages and Repreſentations of it in Apparitions made to the ancient Patriarchs, without the view of his Colour, Stature, and Lineaments, as well as after, when we have certainly loſt the trueſt form of Chriſt? and go by gueſs and uncertain tradition? Again, could not there be drawn the Image of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before Chriſt, and can there now? I would fain ſee how? where? or by whom? What? Becauſe Chriſt, who is a Spirit, who is God, may be drawn according to his Humane nature, may be alſo according to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? The Divine Perſon may indeed, but the Divine Nature can no more now than before be reſembled; and that Deity only by concomitance and implication, and not in form at all. When the Image of a Man is made, the Image of him is made who hath a ſpiritual and divine Soul, but the Image of his Soul is not at all made: and much leſs is the Image of God made (unleſs metonymically, as Man is ſaid to be the Image of God) when Chriſt is figured unto us. But could this be, which neither can, nor ought to be, what warrant at all can it be to make the Image of God in contradiction to Chriſt, as is pleaded for, and uſual among Roman Catholicks? when they,

Could not all this foul daubing of the Deity have been made before Chruſts Incarnation? Or ought it in any ſober mans judgment to be made now? Laſtly, becauſe they ſpeak of ſome ſpecial Diſpenſation to do this now, which was never allowed formerly, let them be ſo ingenuous and cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, I hold it abſolutely forbidden the Jews by the ſame Law, to make uſe of any Images in the worſhip of God; though not to that degree as to worſhip them, but only, <hi>By</hi> them, and that for fear of Idolatry; and if not in paſſing by or neglecting God himſelf, and directing and fixing the mind and heart on the viſible Object, yet by help of that: For that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the mind of God, as may appear by the whole Body of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and every part thereof inſtituted by himſelf, without the leaſt inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of ſuch manner of worſhip: Nay, it is very ſtrange what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath obſerved, That though indeed in practice it hath been connived at, yea<note place="margin">Nam ut Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ſint in Templis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> commended, yet have not men dared as yet by any direct Precept to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the uſe of Images, at all, in Churches. <hi>For that Images ſhould be in Churches</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eraſmus) no Conſtitution, ſo much as humane, requireth: And as is is more eaſie, ſo is it more ſafe to withdraw all Images out of Churches, then to prevail that the Mean ſhould not be exceeded, nor Superſtition mingled therewith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If that Rule of Explication holds good, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue where a ſin is forbidden, there the occaſion leading thereunto is alſo forbidden, I make no doubt, but to worſhip the Creatour, or any Creature by an Image, is alſo here forbidden as Idolatrous, though perhaps not Idolatry abſolute. And contrary to the current ſenſe and diſtinction of modern Romaniſts concerning <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal</hi> Idolatry (of which we have before ſpoken) denying an errour about the Object to be Formal Idolatry, provided the intention be directed to the only true object of worſhip, God, we may more ſafely and properly call this outward viſible adoration given to outward objects, or at leaſt, ſeeming to be given to them, <hi>Formal Idolatry,</hi> than <hi>Material:</hi> becauſe there is nothing wanting to common ſenſe which might make and denominate it Idolatry, and this to have the Formalities of Idolatry: but if they take <hi>Formal</hi> for the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſpecification of a thing, then it is a Contradiction and Nonſenſe to ſay, or ſuppoſe that there can be any Idolatry not <hi>Formal;</hi> as to imagine any thing can be without its form, or that which is abſolutely neceſſary to make it what it is.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this worſhipping of God by any thing made, is forbidden by this command, if not as ſimply and immediately unlawful in it ſelf, yet under the head of Scandal unjuſtly and unneceſſarily given: For in this
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:55232:274"/>
Caſe, it will no more, if ſo much as excuſe a man from the juſt ſuſpicion of Idolatry, that he upon occaſion declares he does not worſhip the thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which he worſhips, than it could do them of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſpeaks, who ſat in the Idols Temple, being Chriſtians, and knowing an Idol was as much as nothing in the world: and a man having ſo much Faith and Knowledge, might do as he pleaſe in neglect and contempt of that: but St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not be put off ſo, but knowing, and taking for<note place="margin">v. 7. 10, 11.</note> granted that ſome did eat before an Idol with a conſcience and ſenſe of an Idol, as it were, adjured ſuch preſumers under the terrour of being acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ruin of their brothers Souls, not to have to do with them. So what if it be true (as moſt true it is) a man may worſhip God or Saints before an Image, and have a right intention and pure conſcience towards God, is it not alſo as true, that he may have an erroneous and idolatrous intention? Nay, are not the Evidences and Preſumptions much more clear and ſtrong that his intention is corrupt, then that it is pure? Can fleſh and bloud put any difference between the viſible act of him that doth worſhip an Image directly and properly, and of him that doth not? Is not this then ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſin? So that we may reaſonably conclude this Command to ſtretch it ſelf to forbid all worſhip by Images, and eſpecially in publick, where there is more danger to others; though not under the ſame guilt or penalty as flat idolizing of any thing beſides God: For in that it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them,</hi> is plainly forbidden external reverence to, or before them in any way of Religious worſhip: In that it is ſaid, <hi>Nor worſhip them,</hi> is expreſſed the internal act, and forbidden.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the more literal ſenſe of this Precept: the more remote and reductive ſenſe (as I may call it) is to interdict all worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations or vain opinions, which are certain Idols of the mind, as the other are of the outward ſenſes. And thus <hi>Hierom</hi> upon the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>

And, to name no more, to be remiſs, prophane, and negligent in the true Service and Worſhip of God, either by inward averſion or outward abſenting themſelves without juſt cauſe from him in his houſe, and denying him that outward adoration and humiliation, which he here forbids us to give any but himſelf: which he ſurely never would have done, had he not ſet ſome value on it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="508" facs="tcp:55232:275"/>And on the contrary, we are required poſitively here to give all outward as well as inward worſhip to him, as he is, in his illimited nature, without circumſcribing him in our minds, or likening him to any corporeal being, how excellent ſoever.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Part of this Commandment gives us the reaſon of it, <hi>viz. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;</hi> deterring all men from the violation of the ſame, from the Power, Majeſty, and Juſtice of him againſt ſuch contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his worſhip and his word. So that as too often it is ſeen, that ſome fond, worldly, and covetous Parents, will even venture their own necks, and damn their ſouls out of an extream deſire to advance their children, and to ſettle them ſure and flouriſhing (as they think) in the world after them, God confounds this their plot and purpoſe, declaring that ſuch a ſin as this ſhall certainly be the ruin of the Family; For he will <hi>viſit the ſin of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the third and fourth generation of them that ſo hate him:</hi> That is, either He will after ſome intermiſſion, and when it may be ſuppoſed that God will take no notice of the iniquity of them that thus offend him by Idolatry or Sacriledge (which the Apoſtle matches together as both offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 22.</note> againſt this Commandment) then will God ariſe and revenge himſelf upon the Poſterity of ſuch Malefactours: Or ſecondly, <hi>to the third and fourth Generation,</hi> that is, beginning to plague the unhappy Off-ſpring of ſuch ungodly Progenitours, he will not give over till the third and fourth Generation; by which kind of perſecution, it may well be believed an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction may have conſumed that race.</p>
                  <p>And to the common Querie here raiſed, How God can juſtly puniſh the Children for the Parents Iniquity? (not to trouble men with the many, diverſe, and tedious ſubtleties wont to be ſhown in anſwer hereunto) This plain and ſimple Anſwer may ſuffice. Firſt, that in matters of rapine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, fraud, and the like, whereby men deſign to enrich themſelves and Poſterity, with great injury done to God or Man; for God out of his wiſe and juſt Providence to take away from the third and fourth Generation that which was wickedly acquired and poſſeſſed properly, the firſt Offender, is, in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech, no hard meaſure or puniſhment properly, but common juſtice and equity, yea a favour, in forbearing to exact that till ſo long time after, which he might the ſame day have moſt juſtly required back again from the firſt offender, in that kind, or his immediate ſucceeder in that injuſtice. For ill-gotten, or unjuſtly detained goods can never in the eyes of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a good title to him that poſſeſſes, or inherits them: And therefore the world indeed may well call the impoveriſhing of ſuch offenders, a <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi> and <hi>curſing</hi> of them and their Eſtate, but in truth, it is a kindneſs in God to deferr the execution of his juſtice for ſome times, that Repentance and Reſtitution might prevent his wrath. Neither can it be thought injuſtice that God doth not alwayes puniſh in the very ſame kind as the offenſe was committed in. For certainly, if with man it be juſt to puniſh the Body of Malefactours, as well as in their Eſtates, wherein perhaps the offence hath been committed, it is no leſs juſt with God, who is abſolute Soveraign over us, to chooſe his way of afflicting an Offender.</p>
                  <p>But in ſome Caſes there ſeems to be rather a perſonal puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon Heirs of wicked Parents, and this ſeems to be hard when it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for their ſakes rather than for any guilt of their own. To which, the Anſwer is: That every man hath ſo much guilt of ſin upon him, that God might at his pleaſure have inflicted what puniſhment, and when he pleaſes: yet thoſe general ſins incident to moſt men, would not have excited Gods
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:55232:275"/>
diſpleaſure to that height, nor cauſed him to execute his juſt vengeance, but he conſiders that ſuch of his Predeceſſors offended in ſuch a kind, as he will early or late revenge; and takes occaſion from thence to puniſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Poſterity, as to thoſe things, which otherwiſe, though out of ſevere juſtice he might have puniſhed upon other reſpects, he would have reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and paſſed over. But then indeed is there more apparent reaſon on Gods ſide when (as <hi>Thomas</hi> reſolves the doubt) the Children inherit the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil minds and Conſciences of their Parents, as well as the Effects of their Evil Conſciences. And thus is this Commandment found conſiſtent with the large vindication God by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> makes of himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 4. 20.</note> he ſhews that the Child ſhall not dye for the ſin of his Father, which was the principal doubt. And it is much more eaſie by the Rule of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to underſtand the reaſon, why God promiſes to be merciful to thouſands in them that love him and keep his Commands. For God being abſolute, and able to diſpenſe with his own Laws, though a Righteous Father ſhould have a wicked Son, God may for the Fathers ſake ſpare the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his juſt anger on the Poſterity for the Fathers ſake, taking occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thence, as many Inſtances of Scripture do plainly inform us.</p>
                  <p>The third Precept of the Decalogue is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. III.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord thy God will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> Which conſiſteth alſo of two principal Parts: The <hi>Precept</hi> it ſelf; and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> confirming and enforcing the ſame. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: and in its ſtrict and proper ſenſe doth only forbid falſe ſwearing, or forſwearing in the uſe of the Name of God. And Oaths are uſually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, <hi>Aſſertorie</hi> and <hi>Promiſsorie.</hi> An <hi>Aſſertorie</hi> Oath is that whereby a man doth affirm or deny any thing, and that in the Name of God. If therefore a man ſhall make uſe of Gods Name to give credit and weight to his Aſſertion, which is falſe, as he frames it, he notoriouſly abuſes the Name of God, and incurs the ſevere puniſhment annexed to, and denounced againſt the breach of this Commandment: He takes Gods Name in vain with a witneſs, as we ſay.

                     <hi>of a mans mind and intention, whereby he obliges himſelf to perform ſome act to another acceptable to him, and that by the Name of God, uſed to aſſure the ſame:</hi> For a man to neglect or diſregard, or willingly to violate this Promiſe ſo confirmed by Oath, is to take Gods Name in vain. To trifle and dally with that moſt ſacred Name and Majeſty: yea, to bring it down ſo low, as to ſerve baſe offices and acts of drudgery and wickedneſs, that no ingenuous or honeſt man with patience could endure. It is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to belye and ſlander God, affirming that he knows ſuch a thing to be true, which is known by him to be utterly falſe; but to make him, as far as may be, acceſſary and inſtrumental to ſuch villanies as he wickedly purpoſes to commit. It is plainly to mock him, and to give and take away again preſently. Nay laſtly, ſeeing (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>An Oath is the end of all ſtrifes;</hi> and there is ſcarce found any other means, and to be ſure none like it to determine Controverſies between man and man, without which no juſtice can take place, and without which humane Society cannot ſubſiſt or continue: To be paltry, and frivolous, or frivolous, or mercenary, or careleſs, or impudent in ſwearing for fear or love of any thing but God, and his ſacred Truth (for <hi>God is Truth</hi>) is the higheſt affront can ordinarily be put upon the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:55232:276"/>
Divine Majeſty: And therefore, when God ſays, he <hi>will not hold ſuch guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> that thus take his name in vain, it is figuratively to be underſtood, God intending ſurely utter ruin and confuſion to ſuch Atheiſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners and affronters of him to his face, and before the face of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>And reductively to this command doth pertain the ſin of light, cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and needleſs uſe of Gods name ſo ſacred, upon no ſufficient grounds or occaſions. This is indeed to take Gods Name in vain, and this will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not ſuffer to go unpuniſhed: For this is in a manner to make ſport with Gods Name, and to make him a laughing ſtock to uſe his Name, and that many times under the form of broad Oaths, to make the lye, or jeſt, or ſrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery take the better, and degrade and diſgrace God Almighty, to grace their ſpeeches, their tales, and witleſs, worthleſs, ſhameleſs language. For how ſtupid and miſerable is the errour of ſuch who move admiration and laughter by moſt unſeaſonable and uncivil, as well as ungodly abuſing of Gods Name, while they think they are admired for their gallantry and wit, when really they are ridiculous for the incongruity, monſtrouſneſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdneſs of their ſpeeches: For what is it elſe for a man to bring Gods magnificient and glorious Name down from Heaven to juſtifie a meer toy or trifle, and that commonly a known lye, which he ſhall vent at pleaſure; but as if a man ſhould bring a huge Cable to tye a fly by the legg? This would indeed make men laugh, but at nothing ſo much as the folly of the Actour of it. And ſo in prophane and beaſtly matters, to utter the Name of God with great boldneſs, it is very likely that as ſome would tremble, others, to whom the wit is principally deſigned, would laugh loud enough; &amp; the abſurd Coxcomb apt to think it is in applauſe of his wit, when really it is at his impudence and preſumption; as they would undoubtedly at him that ſhould break wind backward in the Kings preſence: And what is ſuch kind of ſwearing, but breaking wind forward on Gods face? There's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the wit and mirth too. But no more of this.</p>
                  <p>The poſitive Vertues required by this Commandment, are often, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend, and affectionate uſing of Gods Name in Prayer, Praiſes, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our ſelves and others: To confeſs God before men to the glory of God, though to the diſadvantage and dammage of our ſelves, when the Caſe requires, according to our Saviours words: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>me before men, him ſhall the ſon of man alſo confeſs before the Angels of God.</hi> And more particularly, is required by this Commandment, ſober and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious ſwearing upon juſt occaſion: For can any man of Religion or Reaſon imagine, that if (as ſome of late, and not till of late) ſuppoſe, God would not have men ſwear at all, he would paſs that over in ſilence not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, but through the whole Scripture, and give rules and orders how they ſhould ſwear, as here he doth? In that therefore God here ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſwear in vain:</hi> he certainly implyeth a permiſſion and right to ſwear by his Name rightfully; and no other argument ought to be brought to prove the ſame, eſpecially by us here aiming at brevity. But we have the Examples both of Old and New Teſtament proving this. To them of the New Teſtament, I know not well what they can, or have replyed, St. <hi>Paul</hi> being frequent in it: as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 20. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 5. unleſs they ſay, That being divinely inſpired, he had a particular diſpenſation; which is as much as nothing; it being not at all proved that this was from Diſpenſation, and not known Right. And to them of the Old Teſtament, they ſay, <hi>It was a meer legal thing:</hi> but this alſo is only
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:55232:276"/>
ſaid, and not ſhewed as it ought to be: Nay the contrary may be ſhewed; becauſe nothing was meerly legal or determining with the Law, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not with the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but the Examples of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who all ſwore, were much ancienter then the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and therefore it was a <hi>Natural</hi> Law rather than <hi>Moſaical,</hi> whereby men ſwore anciently, and that was not diſgraced, nor altered by the Law of the Goſpel. But this miſerable miſtake is moſt frequent in the argumentations of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, but unski<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ul Treaters, and as they would be thought admirers of Scripture, that a juſt and righteous document ſhall fare the worſe for being found by them in the Old Teſtament, though not at all relating to the Moſaical Law: and when they ſee cauſe, be rejected and diſgraced, becauſe it is there found.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay they, there are many places in the New Teſtament, as of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and St. <hi>James,</hi> ſtrictly inhibiting ſwearing at all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 24. 36. and chap. 23. 16, 18, 20. <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. Theſe places being urged hard by Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts have driven men to a diſtinction never thought of till of late, and then chiefly, if not only by them of the Reformation, and eſpecially beyond the Seas; whoſe Common-places generally diſtinguiſh between an Oath Publick, and exacted by the Magiſtrates, and an Oath Private, offered and uttered without any ſuch Authority. That (ſay they) is lawful and not prohibited by the Scripture, but this they grant is. But upon tryal, as current as this notion is, there will be found nothing in Antiquity, nothing in Scripture, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the nature of the thing it ſelf, warranting it, or making it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſwear that in private, with the due conditions of an Oath mentioned by <hi>Jeremy, viz. in Truth,</hi> in <hi>Judgment</hi> (not neceſſary publick but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 2.</note> and <hi>in Righteouſneſs,</hi> which a man way ſafely and innocently ſwear in publick. For who was over <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> to require them to ſwear to others? Who can legitimate the Oaths of Princes one towards another? Who do except againſt the mutual ſtipulations of man and wife in contracts, becauſe they are not alwayes performed before a Magiſtrate? Princes when they treat with one another, are but as private men: And yet all theſe ſwear ſolemnly and lawfully. And the reaſon of an Oath imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſwear given by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth juſtifie this: For if an Oath be the end of all ſtrifes, how ſhall thoſe controverſies be ended between private men without an Oath, when no Magiſtrate is at hand? If an Oath will effect peace and ſatisfaction without repairing to the Magiſtrate, what ſhould hinder but it ſhould have its natural effect and end, without moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Magiſtrate? Can the Magiſtrate make that part of the Worſhip of God (as lawful ſwearing is ſaid to be) which in it ſelf is not the Worſhip of God? But it may here be queſtioned farther, What? hath not the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magiſtrate greater influence and power over an Oath than private men? To which I anſwer, that in this the lawful Powers have a ſpecial Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above others, in reference to an Oath; that though it be juſt and lawful to ſwear without commiſſion or command from the Magiſtrate, yet no man can exact an Oath but the Magiſtrate. It is free in private caſes to give or refuſe an Oath: but when lawful Authority pleaſes, it may extort an Oath from another, for the manifeſtation of truth, and to end differences; which no private man ought, or can do, any mor without a mans conſent, that he can take away his purſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This Right in private Perſons to determine differences by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Oaths, appears from the tacite conſent of ſuch as openly deny it. For they generally practiſe it themſelves, and it is altogether unavoidable by
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:55232:277"/>
them that have any commerce or controverſies in the world: it being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unto all men to appeal to God, when they have truth and juſtice on their ſides, not ſo appearing to others. What is more neceſſary for the gaining of belief, and giving ſatisfaction to doubters, than to ſay, <hi>God is my witneſs: I call God to witneſs. God he knows,</hi> and ſuch like, all which are forms of ſwearing, though not after the manner of Judicial proceedings. And who doth not fall into theſe, unleſs we chance to except a ſullein and ſuperſtitious Sect, whoſe Religion is of their own making? <hi>For an Oath is</hi>

                     <hi>day, Six dayes, &amp;c.</hi> of which we have ſpoken what may ſuffice our ends, where we diſcourſed of the Circumſtance of Time of Gods worſhip. And to determine the doubts of late about the morality or ceremonialneſs of this Precept, would require a diſtinct Volume. It may only here be noted that Nothing in this Precept doth directly and immediately bind Chriſtians, but only Reductively, according to the opinions of ſuch who hold that All Evangelical Acts are reducible to the Decalogue, as well as Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts. But if the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſufficed not to adviſe us direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly of our duty towards God and our Neighbour, can we think that ſo ſmall a Segment, ſo few Lines as the Decalogue, are ſufficient? If the Law had been ſufficient, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> The Goſpel had been in<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 21. &amp; 3. 21.</note> vain. Yet do we acknowledge a natural equity and juſtice contained in the Fourth Commandment, which may give grounds to found other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Goſpel than are there expreſſed. And ſome of the Jewiſh Doctours, whom <hi>Grotius</hi> citeth, and much approveth, do diſtinguiſh<note place="margin">Grotius in Decalogum.</note> this Commandment from it ſelf: For they ſay, That part of it is Moral (not as is not amiſs held by many, that it hath thorow out a Moral and a Moſaical or Ceremonial ſenſe) and part Judaical; as they would demonſtrate by the reaſon of it given expreſly and implicitely: For they ſay, That theſe words, <hi>Remember that thou keep holy the Seventh day,</hi> do bind from the reaſon of
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:55232:277"/>
the Creation, and Gods making the World: but that the Jews were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſt from all labour on that day, was from the conſideration of their particular deliverance from the ſervitude of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to remember to ſanctifie the Seventh day, in commemoration of the Creation of the World; but ſo to ſanctifie it, as to reſt from all Labours, in commemoration of their hard labours in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from which they were delivered. Of which interpretation we may ſay thus much; That it very well agrees with the reaſon given in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> of the Sabbath, which is<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 14, 15</note> omitted in <hi>Exodus.</hi> For there the Command is enforced thus, immediately after the Precept of Reſt, <hi>And remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, through a mighty hand, and ſtretched-out arm, therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.</hi>

                     <hi>dayes may be long,</hi> &amp;c. which words have two Parts; The Precept and the Motive or Reaſon of the Precept. In the Precept is to be obſerved the Ground of it, and the Form of it. And what is the Ground and Original of Childrens Duty and Obedience to their Parents, and of Servants to their Maſters, and of Subjects to their Soveraign, but a preventing benefit which they receive from them. And ſurely one, if not the onely (next to his own glory) end of Gods requiring here obedience of Inferiour to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, is the natural and moral benefits derived by them to their Inferiours; and that by Gods will and appointment too. So though it is ſcarce to be ſuppoſed that Parents or Governours ſhould ſo unnaturally fail of their duty and deſign God had in ſetting them over others, as to acquit theſe from rendring honour to them; yet the better to facilitate, and to oblige more ſtrongly Inferiours to do their duties, God doth in this Command alſo require that Parents of all ſorts ſhould conſcionably diſcharge their part to their Children. For there being two general motives to all duties, Love and Ingenuity, and fear of evil and neceſſity, it is not ſo prudent nor ſo powerful to hang all upon one, as on both. 'Tis true, God hath put power into the hands of Parents and Princes and Governours to conſtrain and exact the duty of Obedience from their reſpective Subjects: but he hath put a natural principle of Love into their hearts alſo, inclining them to goodneſs towards them; which notwithſtanding is neither ſo general nor effectual, but many fail egregiouſly in it: wherefore God, by his holy Word, advertiſeth and exhorteth to the exerciſe of it; and as it were, the better to diſpoſe and bow thoſe in ſubjection to them, to perform their duty with cheerfulneſs. And therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after the duty of Obedience impoſed upon Children, layeth a duty upon Parents on their Children, ſaying: <hi>And ye Fathers provoke not your Children; but bring them up in the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Lord:</hi> That is, Exerciſe not imperiouſly and impertinently that power God hath given you over your Children, rather be known ye can do it; and ſo, when it is diſcerned, that it is rather the Luſt of a tyrannous nature, than of natural care, love, or kindneſs which urges them to rule with vain rigour, the Children be provoked to break their bonds, and paſs the bounds which otherwiſe might have been obſerved to the glory of God, and comfort of both: Yet doth not the Apoſtle juſtifie ſuch exceſs in children, more than the extream of Parents; but only foretels the evil event of ſuch unchriſtian rigour.</p>
                  <p>And the like may be ſaid of Servants and Maſters mentioned next by the Apoſtle: who having preſcribed an Evangelical principle of demeanor<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="514" facs="tcp:55232:278"/>
of Servants towards their Maſters, doth ſubjoyn the like Precept to Maſters. <hi>And ye Maſters do the ſame things unto them, forbearing threatning, knowing that your Maſter alſo is in Heaven: neither is there reſpect of perſons with him:</hi> Intimating the ground of hearty, ingenuous, and faithful ſervice of Children and Servants, to proceed commonly from the Fountain of love and kindneſs in the Parents and Maſters: and therefore, if they would be well ſerved, they ſhould firſt ſerve God themſelves, in educating them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods gentle Law, and be careful to inſtruct them in the fear of God. And ſo where the Apoſtle ſtateth the mutual obligation between<note place="margin">Eph. 5 21, 25.</note> Man and Wife, he tempereth his counſel with reciprocal kindneſſes, that as the Wife is to ſubmit her ſelf to her own Husband, the Husband is to love his Wife, and that by vertue of this Commandment, which can never be well kept, according to Gods mind, where there is a faileur on either hand; though St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, like a true Evangelical Preacher, that with good Chriſtians and true Believers, it is no exemption from duty and proper ſubjection, that our Superiours tranſgreſs the laws of modeſty, ſobriety and moderation towards us. But Servants, and by the ſame rule, Subjects and Children ought to be ſubject with all fear, <hi>not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward;</hi> and that for reaſons immediately following: And the<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 18, 19, 20. Titus. 2. 9.</note> ſame requireth St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it is queried by ſome, Why St. <hi>Paul</hi> having taken occaſion to adjuſt the duties between Maſters and Servants, Parents and Children, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives, omitteth wholly to reſtrain and regulate the power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards their Subjects, leaves no Rules for them, as if they might offend, or offending might not be informed of their duty by Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</p>
                  <p>To this we ſay, Firſt, what ſome have well obſerved and affirmed before us, The reaſon hereof is, becauſe in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes there were no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Powers of the Chriſtian Religion; and therefore it might have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unſeaſonable and vain, to offer counſel and rules to them who were not capable of them: For had there been ſuch Princes, no doubt is to be made but he would have ſeaſoned them, and ſanctified them with his wholſome documents.</p>
                  <p>And yet Secondly, He doth not abſolutely diſmiſs them without advice, who may be well reduced to the Head of Parents of Countries, and Maſters of their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the principle of honouring our Superiours, from the benefit of their duties towards us. Now the Principles of Obedience more immediately obliging us unto them, are in brief, The Fear and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, whoſe Image, Repreſentatives, and Inſtruments they are for our Good. No man after ſo many Reaſons and Precepts given us in holy<note place="margin">Luke 10. 16.</note> Scripture of faithful and conſcionable ſubmiſſion to our Superiours, can be ſaid to fear God, who doth not honour his Superiours: For of all Civil Parents or Governours, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are the Miniſters of God to thee</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4. Eccleſ. 7. 27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>for good:</hi> And of our Natural Parents well admoniſheth the Wiſe-man, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father with thy whole heart, and forget not the ſorrows of thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Act, <hi>Honour,</hi> doth imply all inward affection and proper humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind; and all outward demonſtrations of the ſame, by ſober, modeſt, humble reſpect and reverence unto them: As alſo ſervice, aſſiſtance, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

So that he holds it ſcarce lawful in ſuch a caſe as ſhipwrack, for one man to ſave his own life, by thruſting another man of a planck, which might have carried him to land; and ſo, to return<note place="margin">Ne dum ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem defendat, Pietatem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminet. <hi>Ambr. 31 Off. cap.</hi>

                     <pb n="516" facs="tcp:55232:279"/>And this way of arguing, which is yet the only of any colour, is of much leſs force to make wars unlawful, being denounced by juſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as late Fanaticks would pretend at leaſt to hold, to gain eſteem of men of ſingular conſciences, which yet groſs experience hath certified us, extends no farther than opportunity and advantage have enabled and encouraged them to violate. For a man hath not power abſolute over his own perſon, but is under the command of his Superiours, who are to judge of the reaſonableneſs of the endangering his own life, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life of another. For if we ſhould ſo far affront the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to grant a man might not uſe any Self-defence to the apparent loſs of the life of another, it would not from thence follow at all that he might not receive power and authority, and ſuch a command (which to deny were ſinful) to bereave another of his life. How many examples in the Old Teſtament juſtifie this? In the New Teſtament, having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch Chriſtians as had any Soveraign Political Power, do we wonder that we have neither Example nor Precept directly commending this to Chriſtian practiſe?

And when the Souldiers came to St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> enquiring, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> He did not ſay, <hi>Lay down your Commiſſion: Serve no longer:</hi>

                  <p>And whereas the words of Chriſt in his Sermon on the Mount, ſeem to<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 22, 38, 39, 40, 41.</note> be pretended to the contrary, Chriſt there exhorting patiently to bear affronts and injuries, without revenging a mans ſelf; they are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of violence repayed without lawful Authority, either expreſſed or implyed: but this is alwayes implyed in juſt defences. And again, theſe are rather Counſels, than Commands, peremptorily forbidding ſo to do, but adviſing to forbear that out of a Spirit of meekneſs and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is not utterly unlawful to do, but to the diſadvantage of the Goſpel in general, and the diminution of that reward annexed to the humble and patient ſuffering of wrongs for Gods ſake: But though this is to be preferred before the other, it follows not, that the other is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: or that it is ſo much as lawful to forbear executing juſtice on ſuch offenders, when commanded by good Authority. And ſo do the Jews interpret thoſe words of <hi>Leviticus—Thou ſhalt not ſtand againſt the bloud of thy neighbour,</hi> thus, as <hi>Fagius</hi> hath noted on the place: <hi>Whoever</hi>

                  <p>It being thus explained, what is <hi>not</hi> meant by this Command, what <hi>is</hi> by it intended, may more briefly be declared: and that, as in other Precepts, is of two ſorts, Negative, Not to murder: againſt which foul and crying ſin, ſo much and ſo plainly is denounced in holy Writ, that to recount them here in this ſhort Comment, were unſeaſonable and ſuperfluous. It may be defined, <hi>A wilful and unjuſt taking away the life of a Man.</hi> And there
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:55232:279"/>
are two principle Cauſes of this unjuſtneſs. Firſt, No good or warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ground or demerits: Secondly, No good Authority ſo to do. Now Authority is twofold, Expreſs, and Implicite. There is no expreſs Law commanding the deſtruction of another that ſeeks mine, but Implicite there is; and ſo it may be juſt. Expreſs is that which exerciſeth it ſelf againſt convicted Malefactours. And of both theſe is he deſtitute who executeth himſelf. I cannot ſay that it is unlawful for a man required by juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to kill himſelf: but of himſelf to do this, is certainly a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, though he were guilty of Death.

                  <p>The Seventh Commandment interdicteth all uncleanneſs in theſe<note place="margin">§.

There is ſome variety in the New Teſtament in the reciting of this Command: For <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 9. and <hi>Luke</hi> the 18. 20. the order of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in <hi>Exodus</hi> is kept; <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. 18. the order of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi> is followed; which teaches that the diverſity was ancient, and that not ſtood ſcrupulouſly on. But the putting of, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> before <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery</hi> in <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. not approved by <hi>Philo,</hi> or his Followers, ſhould make that place of <hi>Exodus</hi> more ſuſpected of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration than that of <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the matter not being great, and that only concerning the Greek Tranſlation, the End and Contents of this Law are more ſeriouſly to be attended; which may be conveniently reduced to theſe following heads. Firſt unclean thoughts, and inward motions and diſpoſitions, and moſt of all Reſolutions to offend in act, being not hindered: For this Chriſt our moſt pure Preſident and holy Doctour condemns for adultery in the

                     <hi>after her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart.</hi> Not he that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a woman, but he that looketh on her <hi>to luſt</hi> after her, is condemned, though all curious, ſtudious, idle impertinent views of men or women, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which may follow ordinarily the ſparks, and then the flames of luſt, are forbidden. Again, not all luſting of the heart is to be compared to the acts of luſting inwardly with the act outward joyned to that. Adultery of the heart our Saviour Chriſt doth not equal to the Adultery of act; but makes it Adultery in a degree inferiour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is uncleanneſs of the Tongue too, when it breaketh out into impure, light, fooliſh, laſcivious ſpeeches, tending to begetting evil thoughts and acts in others; againſt which St. <hi>Paul</hi> declareth in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians: <hi>Let no corrupt communication come out of your mouth: but</hi>

And however ſingle perſons do not ſo prodigiouſly abuſe themſelves as did thoſe impure Hereticks, pretending greater Sanctity and deeper Myſteries in their Religion then the Catholicks, yet muſt it needs be a great offenſe to God, ſo to corrupt a mans ſelf in yielding to fleſhly temptations, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Heathen Poets, though themſelves were immodeſt, for a violation of the Law of Nature it ſelf: which therefore all Chriſtians, eſpecially of weak reaſon, ſtrong paſſions, and young years, are moſt watchfully to beware of, and reſolutely to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of acted, rather then actual, Uncleanneſs here prohibited, is the foul ſin of Sodomie, to which the wicked Citizens of <hi>Sodom,</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 4, 5. Rom. 1. 26.</note> by fire, gave denomination, as may appear in the Book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> And of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaketh, when he ſaith that God delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the Gentiles to theſe unnatural Luſts, as a puniſhment of their groſs Idolatry: <hi>For this cauſe God gave them up to vile affections: For even their women did change the natural uſe into that which is againſt nature. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the men leaving the natural uſe of the women, burned in their luſts one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, men with men working that which is unſeemly, and receiving in themſelves that recompenſe of their errours which was meet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Third unnatural Luſt is that called Beſtiality, or abuſing, or being abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Lev. 28. 23.</note> by Beaſts, in luſtful acts, againſt which God hath in his Word, as well as by the Light and Law of Nature, declared.</p>
                  <p>The more natural, but yet unchriſtian Luſts here forbidden are Adultery, which is either ſimple, <hi>viz.</hi> when a married perſon committeth uncleanneſs with an unmarried: where ſome make two kinds, the one when the man is
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:55232:281"/>
married, but the woman ſingle, which they commonly make the leſs, and ſo indeed it is, by reaſon that it brings no ſpurious brood to inherit or ſhare the Goods of any other man, but him that he knowingly and willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows them on. The other is, when the woman is married, and the man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, which is, beſides the general ſin, ſubject to the foreſaid miſchief: And therefore hereby the woman offends in theſe four reſpects: <hi>Incredulity,</hi> not believing or regarding the Law and Word of God to the contrary. 2. <hi>Not reverencing</hi> the Laws of the Church. 3. <hi>Treachery</hi> againſt her Faith and Troth given before God to her Husband, whereby ſhe delivered unto him<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4.</note> the power of her Body, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. as likewiſe doth the Husband to his Wife, upon the ſame occaſion: and therefore thus far the Man and Woman tranſgreſſing, offend equally. 4. They ſay, the Woman in ſuch caſes is <hi>a Thief,</hi> in that ſhe ſpoileth her Husband of his goods, and giveth them to a falſe Iſſue he would knowingly no wayes yield them to.</p>
                  <p>But yet ſaith <hi>Thomas,</hi> the man ſinneth no leſs than the woman, however<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem Praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Opuſc. 3.</note> he may flatter himſelf otherwiſe: And the ſum of his reaſon is this; Firſt, Becauſe that the man hath no more power over his Body than the woman o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hers. Secondly, Becauſe the man is ſtronger naturally than the woman, and endued with more reaſon. Thirdly, Becauſe the man is the Head of the woman, and her teacher, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; therefore, as it is a greater ſin for a Prieſt than a Layman to offend in that kind, ſo is it for a man, who is as it were Gods Miniſter, even in ſpiritual matters to the woman. And in truth we find little or no difference put by the Scripture between the fact<note place="margin">James 4. 4.</note> of the one and the other; St. <hi>James</hi> joyning them thus together, <hi>Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 20. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>God?</hi> Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law decreed the Adultereſs to be put to death, but not the Adulterer, as offending more againſt the Civil capacity of Man: And perhaps for the hardneſs of their hearts, leaſt they ſhould do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God would have it done in a more orderly and juſt way: Some Laws of Chriſtians at this day granting the man leave to kill his wife him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, finding her in actual Adultery.</p>
                  <p>Fornication likewiſe which ſome calling <hi>Simple,</hi> have legitimated in great meaſure, is condemned by this Commandment: St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as it were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, and intending to confound ſuch modern Doctours, ſaith, <hi>Know ye not</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 9, 10.</note>

                     </note> But <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaks ſoundly and plainly, <hi>It is therefore an Hereſie to ſay ſimple Fornication is no mortal ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if ſimple Fornication be, as certainly it is, a mortal ſin, then ſurely it is much more grievous, when it hath the aggravations of <hi>Conſtupration,</hi> or <hi>Deflouring</hi> of a Virgin; her Virginity being her natural grace and glory. And much more <hi>Raviſhing,</hi> or invading violently the chaſtity of others. And ſo <hi>Inceſt</hi> committed againſt the Laws of Nature, of God, or the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we profeſs, concerning conſanguinity and affinity. And there is another Degree of Luſt, which is called <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> extending the word a little of the fartheſt, to expreſs the great wickedneſs of abuſing thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:55232:281"/>
themſelves in a ſtate of Virginity, to Gods Service. For as we have ſhown before, as it is not only lawful, but very commendable in any good Chriſtian, upon ſober and mature conſideration of the probability of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make good ſuch holy reſolutions, to devote himſelf, or her ſelf, to ſuch excellent means of ſerving God, and that by a Vow, ſo can it not be but a notorious offence againſt God, to mock him either with commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fornication, or entring into marriage, otherwayes lawful. If indeed Marriage were ſuch a Law, as ſome groſly conceive of it, that not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, were to offend God, then were it not lawful to deſign any ſuch life as Virginity, nor yet widowhood, being in ordinary capacity; and then were moſt of their arguments good, urged againſt the ſtate of Virginity choſen by way of Vow: But it being a <hi>Jus</hi> or <hi>Right</hi> rather, that every man hath of God, then a <hi>Lex</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> that he ſhould marry, their reaſons prove very fallacious and vain: And they who ſhall go about to ſeduce to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage (and much more, other more ſcandalous and vitious acts) them that have ſo decreed in their heart to live to God, do very wickedly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo great a Preſident as <hi>Luther</hi> may be alledged to the contrary, and the judgment of <hi>Perkins</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To theſe may be reduced all outward acts and ſigns of Lightneſs and Laſciviouſneſs, tending to Wantonneſs and Luſt: Evil Dalliances and Speeches, and Geſtures, and Attire, and Ornaments to inſinuate evil to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to tempt them: as likewiſe Intemperance fomenting the Law of the Members, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, againſt the Law of the mind.</p>

VIII.</note> Gods principal intention it was to preſerve one man from offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or injury to another. Injury is done to man two wayes in General: <hi>To his Perſon;</hi> or <hi>To his Goods and Poſseſſions.</hi> The Injury done to a mans <hi>Perſon,</hi> is either committed againſt him <hi>ſimply;</hi> and this is forbidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murder:</hi> or againſt him <hi>joyntly,</hi> as he is one with another. For ſo God ſaith, <hi>They two ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> man and wife making in ſeveral ſenſes but one Perſon: and therefore to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſon of one, is to wrong both: And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> For hereby notorious injuſtice is done to the perſon ſo united to the Party ſuffering evil. Neither can it be alledged, what too often happens, that there is conſent on one part, and ſo no injury: becauſe firſt, Neither God, nor the other Party, to both which the will of the Offender is to be no leſs ſubject than to himſelf, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>A Second Injury is done to the Goods of a man by ſuſtaining loſs or detriment: and againſt this evil doth God here provide by ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</hi> Concerning which we are to conſider briefly <hi>The Ground, The Extent</hi> or <hi>Kinds,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>The Evil</hi> of Thefts.</p>
                  <p>The Original and Cauſe of this Commandment is certainly Juſtice, and<note place="margin">

God is Juſtice, and ſo is his Will revealed as a Rule of humane affairs. And Juſtice is in man too, concretely, as they ſpeak, and ſo is defined, <hi>A perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and conſtant will of giving every man his due:</hi> though <hi>Gerſon</hi> would have<note place="margin">Gerſon de Vita Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ali, Lect. 3.</note> this to relate principally to God: And that of Fact it doth, is moſt true: it being impoſſible God ſhould do or deſire to do injury to any man: but as of Form and Right it concerneth man no leſs, becauſe he is perpetually and immutably obliged to do juſtly, though actually he doth it not: <hi>For</hi>

                     <hi>without this what are Kingdoms</hi> [or Common-wealths] (ſaith <hi>Auſtin) but Slaughter-houſes?</hi> And much more may we ſay, What is Religion without Juſtice, but extreameſt Villany? there being nothing ſo ridiculous to all men, or blaſphemous to Chriſt, as to imagine a man can be a good Chriſtian, before he is an honeſt and juſt man.</p>
                  <p>This Juſtice hath two parts, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth, <hi>Piety</hi> to God, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lactan. l. 5. cap. 14.</note> to man. For Juſtice (as we have ſhowed in the beginning of this Work) it is, to be Religious towards God, and to worſhip him; and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Injuſtice to deny him ſuch his due. Equity towards Man, is that we even now deſcribed: and which is in this Law commanded. But becauſe Juſtice or Equity are ſaid to be Vertues, whereby a Man gives every one his due or own, they muſt be grounded upon Dominion: and <hi>Dominion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Propriety a man hath to uſe a thing which he poſſeſſeth as he pleaſeth.</hi> The principal act of Injuſtice then, is to violate this Propriety, or withdraw, or withhold any thing from another, which of right belongs to him: not obſerving our Saviours rule in his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>

                     <hi>ye would that men ſhould do to you, do you alſo unto them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> The Law and the Prophets both contained, and here ſignifie the whole ſubſtance of Religion of the Church under the Law, and therefore ſuch moral honeſty and juſtice as this, being the chief ſubject of theſe Books, is likewiſe the ſubſtance of Religion it ſelf, improved by Chriſt to ſome higher perfections.</p>
                  <p>Now the Extent of this ſin of ſtealing or injuſtice, is Firſt, to open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in Robbery, and ſpoiling of others of that which they are rightly poſſeſſed of without colour of Juſtice: which is indeed the moſt notorious of all, becauſe all modeſty and moderation, but what fear of their necks may ſuggeſt, is laid aſide, and all become a prey to them that fall into their hands: To which may be referred all unjuſt and unreaſonable and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, extorting from Subjects that which no cauſe requires: of which <hi>Eſay</hi> complaineth, <hi>Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of Thieves:</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, to clandeſtine frauds and couſenages, which are committed ſundry wayes: 1.

And it is either againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and is called <hi>Peculatus,</hi> or <hi>Pillaging;</hi> when a man robs the Common Stock, or uſes artifices to refuſe to pay thoſe legal dues of Cuſtom or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, or other juſt Taxes made legal by good Authority. Many men think it ſcarce any ſin, which in truth is a notorious one, to cheat the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of what is due to them: but <hi>Solomon</hi> implyeth the contrary when he<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 4.</note> ſaith, <hi>Whoſe robbeth his Father or his Mother, and ſaith it is no tranſgreſſion,

                  <p>Thirdly, not to pay what we owe, and according to the Circumſtances we owe any thing to another, and eſpecially to detain the wages of the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or labourer from him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>James</hi> 5. 4. which will cry againſt the hard Maſter who delayeth to pay what is earnt according to agreement: For as Caſuiſts hath obſerved, He that payeth not exactly according to the known cuſtom and rule, though he afterwards payeth all in kind, yet in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he doth not pay all was due, ſeeing many inconveniencies do commonly happen to the dammage of the Creditour upon ſuch delays. But that which is moſt intolerable and unjuſt, is the too common craft of covetous and wicked minds, to withold, or refuſe due payment of debts upon many vain and unconſcionable pretences, ſo long till the Credit our becoming almoſt deſperate of that debt, ſhall be wrought upon by fear, to abate of his due, leaſt he ſhould looſe all. They who do not pay according to the agreed time, ought rather to adde for ſatisfaction of ſo long detaining to their debt, than to make new capitulations whereby the principal ſum ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, to the loſs of the Creditour.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to uſe adulterations in Commodities, contrary to the common rule and expectations of men, is a ſort of ſtealing and unjuſtice here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: as to mix and corrupt Wines, Siders, Money, Bread, or, after the manner of Druggiſts and Apothecaries, to ſophiſticate any Drugg or Liquor, or to counterfeit any more precious thing with a viler and baſer, is to commit an offence againſt this Command, and no better than ſtealing in the eyes of God, how cuſtomary ſoever this may be, and with a ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and bold face carried on. Nay frequently this is worſe a great deal than ſimple filching and ſtealing, in that the bodies of men are often by ſuch ſophiſtications, if not poyſoned, yet corrupted, and ſo ends in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of murder: and if not for the preſent and particular miſchief, yet for the general and gentle, deſerves the halter and hell no leſs than direct Thieves and Murderers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Sacriledge, and open, or ſubtile or private alienation of what is devoted to ſacred and common ends of Religion, and uſurping the ſame to a mans private ſecular uſe, againſt the intention of the thing, hath this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aggravation above common ſimple theft: Firſt, in that what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for publick uſes and ends, is perverted to particular: For example, Endowments and Donations made to Churches, ſerve not only to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of that Perſon, who in that capacity poſſeſſes them, but to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and comfort of all in that diſtrict communicating in Spiritual things: wrong is done unto all them, who upon the withdrawing of ſuch due ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, want their due miniſtrations. Secondly, in ordinary thefts or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the matter paſſes but from ſecular to ſecular ends; but in Sacrilegious Thefts, it paſſes from one kind to another: from Spiritual to Secular or Temporal, beſides the particular injury done to the Perſon to whom it is due.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid in defenſe of Sacriledge, that the owners of ſuch Spiritual Maintenances abuſe them themſelves by lazy, luxurious, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vitious courſes, contrary to the true end of them; all this may be
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:55232:283"/>
granted and lamented; But they who preach up vertue out of ſuch wicked principles and ends, ſhould withal conſider how this involves the ſecular as well as ſpiritual Perſon. For no man hath any legal temporal Right to any eſtate ſo far, as that it ſhould prejudice the common good. And if upon vitiouſneſs of the one, the eſtate he owneth may be alienated, will it not hold good in the other? And have not the King and Judicial Courts as great power over Temporal eſtates as Eccleſiaſtical? We can give many inſtances ſacred and humane, whereby it ſhould ſeem he hath greater. And would theſe zealous men for vertuous and ſober life, hold it reaſonable the Eſtates of Spendthrifts, and Drunkards, and Whoremaſters ſhould be taken from them by violence, and given to ſoberer men? I would fain ſee the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparity. This ſcarce any but ſees, to the advantage of Eccleſiaſtical reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues above Secular: That if the Party poſſeſſing them committeth Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt his Soveraign, neither Religion nor Common Laws do adjudge ſuch Eſtates to be confiſcated to the Crown, as they do others, which argues that Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates are put more out of the Kings power than are Secular; and therefore more unreaſonably are ſeized on than theſe. It is true, the King is in a more immediate way a <hi>Guardian</hi> and Protectour of Church-eſtates, than of the Secular: but Guardians have no more Intereſt or intrinſick Right to the Eſtate they diſpoſe of to the true owner, than they have of other mens. Or does it at all extenuate the crime, that frequently it is committed againſt ſuch perſons as cannot help themſelves? Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cold Friends to the Churches Right in ſuch Caſes, hath obſerved and been conſtrained to confeſs, that the diſpleaſure, or to ſpeak without mincing, the Curſe of God hath purſued thoſe more then ordinary, and egregiouſly fruſtrated their hopes and expectations, who have fingered or graſped Church poſſeſſions: great uſurpations of this kind ſerving no farther, and doing no more good, than a Jugg of Beer doth a good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I will favour mine own Country ſo far, as to forbear all inſtances might here be given, and only mention that I find in <hi>Paggius.</hi> Petrus de Vineis <hi>an Italian, and prudent Counſeller, and Secretary to</hi> Frederick <hi>the Emperour, called</hi> Barbaroſſa, <hi>who had wars with Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>the Third, and advanced far into</hi> Italy <hi>againſt him, was by the calumnies of the</hi> Barbaria <hi>Faction, intimate and prevalent with the Emperour, turned out of office, and had for his puniſhment both his eyes put out.

The Emperour liked the advice very well: and accordingly ſpoiled the Churches of their riches, and ſo raiſed an Army. Which when</hi> Peter <hi>heard, he came boldly to the Emperour, and ſaid; Now I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged ſufficiently of you for my two eyes. You ſtirred up to your ſelf the hatred of men, but I have made God your enemy through your Sacriledge. From this time forward all things will go worſe and worſe with you.</hi> And ſo it fell out, for <hi>Alexander</hi> at length brought down his pride and him to great ſhame and miſery, even to be kicked by the Pope.</p>

But how much happier, how much honeſter, how much holier are they who looſe their ears in the publick Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory, than ſuch ſolemn and grave Cheats in their Shops, who looſe their ſouls? cuſtomarineſs and commonneſs extenuating the ſin; and the courſe of trading, and art of growing rich apace, as requiring, ſo almoſt juſtifying ſuch abominations. But no more, though not enough of this.</p>
                  <p>We are now briefly to touch and recommend to the true Chriſtian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, not only juſtice in doing right to all men, but doing good to all men,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> as the Apoſtle exhorteth: and the Rule of Contraries in expounding the Commandments, which is, that <hi>where a Sin is forbidden expreſly, there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly is a vertue commanded,</hi> as where a vertue is enjoyned, there the contrary vice is much more interdicted. And ſurely the firſt place is here to be given to repentance, and repentance of ſuch ſin as this doth indiſpenſably require reſtitution or ſatisfaction; without which, if men did not tacitly hold they might be ſaved by the common falſe notion of Juſtifying Faith, ſo many would not ſhipwrack their Souls and Conſciences in acting, living, and dying in ſuch unjuſt wayes as are above mentioned. Of Satisfaction and Reſtitution we have already ſpoken, as neceſſary to Repentance, as Repentance is neceſſary to Salvation; and this ſatisfaction not as relating to God, but unto Man wronged: And therefore I ſhall more fully give Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s judgment in the Caſe, and ſo leave it:

In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he writeth thus: <hi>If what belongs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>

                  <p>But beſides and above this, acts of Mercy and Charity are here required of all good Chriſtians: and not only to keep our hands from any open or clandeſtine violence to others, but to extend and open our hands to the benefit and comfort of others. Not only are we forbidden to take what is not our own, but to keep what is our own, ſo to our ſelves, that the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of our brother and neighbour requiring, we ſhould withhold it from him. <hi>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>when it is in</hi>

And yet farther, Not every thing that we ſay of, and from our ſelves, as true, is a lye though it be falſe: Why? becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this definition a man muſt willingly and ſtudiouſly deſign the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of what is falſe, to make it a proper lye: For if he believes ſincerely, he ſpeaks truth; and intends no otherwiſe to be credited by another, he doth not lye, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> any more than he ſteals, who taketh that which belongs to another man, as his own; preſuming without fraud or wilful errour, that it is ſo: or he committeth adultery, who contrary to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and will, uſeth another woman, as his wife. Yet may all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſin of their reſpective kinds, when that due and ſober attention is neglected which may inform a man better: for if there are offered unto him competent means of knowing the truth, and judging more faithfully, and theſe not being worthily improved, the errour doth redoung to the will, and that weak and general intention can neither excuſe from a lye or Adultery, or Idolatry. Laſtly, not the intention of telling a lye doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſtitute a lyer, but the intention and will to be believed, as true. For of the Three kinds of Lyes frequent amongſt Schoolmen, and other, The <hi>Officious Lye,</hi> The <hi>Pernicious Lye,</hi> and The <hi>Merry</hi> and <hi>Jeſting Lye:</hi> The Two firſt are alwayes Lyes properly taken. The Second alwayes, and without all doubt, evil: The firſt may in ſome caſes be commendable: as killing of a man may be; when the ground is juſt, and the caſe deſerves death, one may be put to death by another, with the warrant of legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And that a man may not deceive that man whom he may lawfully kill, wants proof: I mean by a ſimple lye, wherein the Name of God is not uſed or taken in vain. For though ſuch caſe may be put in which a man may ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him with a lye, whom he may ſlay with the ſword, or ſtrangle with an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being lawfully required; yet muſt not God be ſo far abuſed, or his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Name prophaned, as to be brought to atteſt a falſity.

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:55232:285"/>
which is certain y the truth: when a man doth not ſpeak a thing to the end he may be be ieved, but for recreation. This may come under the reprehenſion of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> adviſing that <hi>Neither filthineſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not convenient,</hi> ſhould be uſed, but rather giving of thanks; but not as the particular ſin of lying, of which we now ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would prove ſuch lying in jeſt a ſin: 1. <hi>Becauſe though it</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perkins on Galat. ch. 1. v. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>hurts not our neighbour, yet it is to the hurt and prejudice of truth.</hi> This is new, &amp; too ſubtile, ſeeing Truth abſtractly taken is inviolable &amp; invulnerable, as God himſelf is, who is Truth: And therefore truth is then only wronged when ſome perſon is wronged for want of Truth and Juſtice: Darkneſs doth not hurt the light, but ſuch perſons only or things as are bereaved of it. But thus to tell a lye, is to tell a pernicious lye; which plainly was St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> mind, who ſaith, <hi>Omnis autem qui mentitur, ea contra id quod animo ſentit, loquitur.</hi> Id ib. 2. He ſaith, <hi>But men are deceived hereby.</hi> But firſt we ſo limit the innocencie of <hi>Jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Lyes,</hi> that they be not ſpoken ſeriouſly, or with any intention to deceive. Secondly, He himſelf grants it lawful to deceive by diſſimulation, or ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of what is not intended in ſome caſes: as in the caſe of God threatning the abolition of the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And of <hi>Joſhuah</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting a flight before <hi>Ay, Joſh.</hi> 8. 5, 6. and of Phyſicians deceiving averſe and unruly Patients. And how can this poſſibly ſtand with that opinion? 3. <hi>He that tells a lye hurts himſelf, though it be for the good of others; for when he ſpeaks the truth indeed, he is leſs believed.</hi> This is true when a man tells a lye indeed, but not when he profeſſes not to ſpeak truth. 4. <hi>There ought to be a conformity between the ſpeech and mind, which is not when a lye is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> This rule fails in many caſes: For if a man minds, or intends to do another a miſchief, muſt he neceſſarily ſpeak conformably, or do confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably, and make good his bad intentions? If a man intends to do one a kindneſs, and give him an eſtate, may he not carry himſelf towards him, and all others, as if he never intended any ſuch thing? But it may be he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain this to poſitive Speeches and Acts, which he would have alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to inward conceptions: And ſo they are when a man intends to deceive, and doth deceive. But that the general appearances muſt conform to the reality of the Intention, his own conceſſions above-noted will not admit. It is true therefore only, when it is juſtly required. And this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to cut the throat of all (as they are now called deſervedly) Jeſuitical Aequivocations, and Mental Reſervations, and External diſſimulations; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe none of their real or pretended Superiours can give them any power not to anſwer according to the ſerious intention and expectation of legal Enquirers: and legal Enquirers they are, who have legal Authority in that Nation. Again, unleſs their Superiours can give them power of Life and Death (as it is an opinion amongſt them they may, eſpecially the Pope) over free Princes and their Subjects, they can give them no power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by poſitive acts or words, lawful Powers, contrary to the common and received ſenſe and meaning of Enquiries and Anſwers. Thirdly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a mans ſelf, nor by any Civil Authority, how great or good ſoever, nor upon any Caſe how important ſoever, can a man lawfully uſe the Name of God in atteſtation of what is falſe, or confirmation of what his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Judgment aſſures him is otherwiſe than he declares it to be. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man give inſtance that God ever permitted it, or any good or holy man in Scripture preſumed to do ſo. And therefore <hi>oequivocation</hi> in any oaths, whether lawfully or unlawfully adminiſtred, is directly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to be deteſted of all men, as it is of God.</p>

                     <pb n="530" facs="tcp:55232:286"/>The Vertue then which this Commandment requires in oppoſition to bearing falſe witneſs, is firſt, a love and veneration of Truth, as the ſacred daughter of God himſelf, and that in all things, and at all times not excepted, but more eſpecially Authority and publick Juſtice requiring it. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements hereunto, abbreviated, <hi>Perkins</hi> hath collected thus to my hands in the forementioned place: 1. <hi>Gods command: James</hi> 3. 14. 2. <hi>Lying is a conformity to the Devil.</hi> 3. <hi>We are ſanctified by the word of truth, John</hi> 17. 17. 4. <hi>Truth is a Fruit of Gods Spirit, Galat.</hi> 5. <hi>A mark of Gods children, Pſalm</hi> 32. 2. and 15. 2. 5. <hi>Deſtruction is the reward of a Lyar, Pſal.</hi> 5. 6. And thus far of the Ninth Commandment.</p>
                  <p>The Tenth is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours houſe, Thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§ X.</note> 
                     <hi>thy neighbours wife, nor his ſervant, nor his maid, nor his Ox nor his Aſs, nor any thing that is his.</hi> Which the modern Roman Church having care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turned the ſecond out of doors, as a quarrelſome and troubleſome companion, are neceſſitated to divide into two, to make up the compleat number of Ten: For which fact they have no ground but St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and them who preciſely followed him. But none of theſe, or any ancient, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on their grounds, <hi>viz. becauſe the Second Commandment gave offence.</hi> Now, ſeeing many more in number and antiquity have otherwiſe than <hi>Auſtin,</hi> conſidered this Commandment as one entirely: The Reaſons why they ſo judge of it are worth enquiring: For ſome eminently learned among them, eſpecially in the Scriptures, have declared expreſly againſt it, as <hi>Oleaſter</hi> and <hi>Mercerus; Petrus Galatinus</hi> inclining that way, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.<note place="margin">Buxtorf. de Decal. num. 74. &amp; 59.</note> And, as a little before he hath noted, the Jewiſh Doctours, who are to ſway much in this Caſe (unleſs the Papiſts pleaſe to diſtinguiſh the Decalogue, as they have audaciouſly the Canon of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, into <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>) have unanimouſly conſpired to make this but one Commandment. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and <hi>Abarbenel</hi> mentions indeed ſuch an opinion as the Roman Church maintains, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the ſame, as a very fond and vain conceit. And the like may be ſaid<note place="margin">Eſtius in Sentent. l. 3. Diſt. 40. §. 3.</note> of <hi>Eſtius</hi> his anſwers and evaſions of the reaſons on our ſide: which are Firſt, That the object of the ſin here forbidden is not to diſtinguiſh the Command ſo much, as the Act, Concupiſcence, of the mind or heart united in one: becauſe then we ſhould have more than two: One prohibiting lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after another mans wife; another luſting after his Servants; another luſting or coveting his cattle; and a fourth his poſſeſſions and moveables. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of this Concupiſcence maketh it but one, where he<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> ſaith, <hi>I had not known luſt except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> The other Precepts therefore having provided againſt the Acts outward of ſin; This in the Concluſion goeth, as it were, over all of them again, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth all inward motions towards any of the ſins before forbidden. To ſay therefore with <hi>Eſtius,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt, is as much as if a man ſhould ſay, Thou ſhalt love, which doth not make all the Commandments but one, is very idle:</hi> ſeeing the word <hi>Luſt</hi> is there taken in an evil ſenſe, and may reaſonably extend to all the Negative precepts at leaſt; as Love doth concern them all, and is the ſum of the Decalogue. But we find no ſuch particular Precept as <hi>Love,</hi> indefinitely taken. And beſides, we are not ſo much to enquire after matter of Right, what might be, or ought to be, but of fact, what is. And to collect what is done, we are not ſo much to conſult the holy Writ of the New Teſtament, which uſes no preciſe or determinate ſpeech in reference to the number or order of theſe Commandments, but the thing it ſelf, which ever amongſt the Jews was thus diſtinguiſhed, as we
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:55232:286"/>
do, and generally the Greek Church, and the Latin likewiſe, until <hi>Auſtin's</hi> dayes. And it is certain, the Holy Spirit here doth not affect Logical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, or Rhetorical Partitions or Methods, but delivers things groſly to a rude people, inculcating the ſame thing under diverſe forms of ſpeech: For according to one of the Rules of expounding the Decalogue, <hi>viz. That where the outward act is forbidden, the inward act is alſo forbidden; and where the Effect, there the Cauſe is alſo forbidden;</hi> this ſhould rather ſeem to be none other Precept than what went before, in the ſeventh and eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments forbidding Adultery and Theft: and by Implication, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of Luſting after the Perſons or Poſſeſſions of others: For that is the beginning and cauſe of thoſe outward Effects, and ſcandalous ſins.</p>
                  <p>Another Reaſon for the entireneſs of that we call the <hi>Tenth Commandment,</hi> is the order obſerved in <hi>Exodus:</hi> where <hi>Luſting</hi> after our Neighbours Houſe, is ſet before <hi>Luſting</hi> after his Wife, or other Perſons: and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain follow his Goods; which ſhows that there was no intention to divide that Period into two Precepts: For then, in all probability, the Perſons ſhould have been ranked by themſelves, and the Goods by themſelves, ſo to diſtinguiſh them: but no heed being given to this, no intention ſeems to be for that. To this they anſwer moſt colourably, <hi>That in Deuteronomy the order is otherwiſe: Coveting ones Neighbours wife being firſt prohibited: and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Law as there repeated, and reviſed, is to be a Preſident to us.</hi> But firſt the contrary to this is moſt true, That the Law was more exactly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in <hi>Exodus</hi> than in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> in all thoſe points which are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them, as hath been ſhewed out of <hi>Grotius:</hi> For <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Name, being indeed a Repetition, in a compendious manner, of what was more expreſly and at large handled in the four firſt Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it cannot be ſuppoſed but many, if not all things, ſhould be in them more plainly and accurately treated of, than in this. For as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

                     </note> hath obſerved of the diverſe manner of reciting the Lords Prayer in Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel and St. <hi>Lukes:</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſetting down ſeven Petitions, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> but five, and thereupon directs us to make St. <hi>Matthews</hi> words the Rule of underſtanding St. <hi>Lukes:</hi> So queſtionleſs where a thing in the Pentateuch is more diſtinctly and fully expreſſed, there ought we to take our meaſures for the interpretation of what is more confuſedly or breifly rehearſed elſewhere: and by conſequence the Law in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is to be regulated by that of <hi>Exodus.</hi> But farther: The order of perſons or things is not in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> obſerved: For firſt it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not deſire thy Neighbours Wife:</hi> then, <hi>Neither ſhalt thou covet thy Neighbours Houſe:</hi> and then follows, <hi>his Servants,</hi> and then again <hi>his Goods:</hi> which ſhew that God would not have us too rigorouſly to ſeek for methods in his word, but matter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the ſum of all is this, That God knowing how imperfect mans underſtanding was, in the matter wherein his ſenſes were concerned; and how willing he was to be deceived and ignorant of his duty; and laſtly, how prone a man is to proceed from evil thoughts to evil deeds, he doth here inform his people in an higher point of Sobriety and Juſtice than Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Philoſophers, or common light of Nature could direct men. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he <hi>had not known luſt</hi> [to be a ſin] <hi>except the Law had ſaid, Thou</hi>

                     <hi>ſhalt not covet:</hi> And our Saviour in the Goſpel interdicteth all vain and laſcivious looks, whereby Luſt may be conceived: The reaſon of all which is this, becauſe, as (the Scripture often intimates unto us) God accepteth the heart for the act, and the will for the deed, where there is a defect of power to bring things to perfection which are righteous and holy; ſo doth God
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:55232:287"/>
judge that Evil to be done againſt him, which is ſo conceived and reſolved upon in the mind, as to want nothing but ability and opportunity to put in execution. For as an holy Father ſaith, <hi>No man is righteous who cannot do</hi>

                  <p>And neceſſary was this Commandment, not only for the reaſons now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but alſo for the general pronity of all men to fall into this ſin.

                     </note> to particular evil motions of the will. For as St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>We do not pray God to forgive us thoſe ſins which we doubt not but are forgiven in baptiſm, but thoſe which through human frailty creep upon us unawares, which though ſmall, are frequent.</hi> So are we not here adviſed to pray againſt, or reſiſt Original ſin, which is irreſiſtible; but the <hi>vermine</hi> of evil thoughts, which are apt to breed in the remains of natural Concupiſcence, as Snakes in a dunghil, which coming to get ſtrength, creep out in evil outward acts, to the endangering of the ſoul. Hence it is that the Scriptures exhort us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the occaſions, and reſiſt the Devil at firſt; and by Faith to quench theſe fiery darts of the Devil that ſhall be ſhot into our ſouls: with ſome of which proper and uſeful means ſo to do, I ſhall conclude this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the outward occaſions of wicked thoughts are carefully and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be avoided; ſuch as are Idleneſs, evil Objects, evil Authours, and evil Company. Secondly, Not to give way, to the leaſt friendly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the firſt motions or injections of the Tempter, but cruſh the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice egg, and quench the ſpark and growing flame at the very firſt. For as when an enemy without throws in a Granado into a Fort to ruin it, if they within take it up preſently and throw it back again, before it breaks, it confounds the Enemy rather then them in the Fort: ſo do evil thoughts caſt into the Soul by the Devil, rather torment him than hurt the Soul, when they are rejected ſuddainly and caſt out. Thirdly, By being inſtant and fervent<note place="margin">Wiſd. 8. 21.

Fourthly, Imploying a mans ſelf conſtantly and carefully in ſome laudable and profitable actions, much ſecures him from the vain illuſions of the mind, from whence do ſpring that Luſt of the Fleſh, Luſt of the Eyes, and Pride of Life, againſt which St. <hi>John</hi> warns us: and all which with their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular branches are forbidden by this laſt Commandment.</p>

The former is a total Renunciation of a Deity: The latter a vehement and exceſſive addition to a Deity, without judgment or ſobriety; <hi>Fearing Doemons or Spirits inſtead of God, and deifying every thing;</hi> or miſtaking the worſhip of the true God.</p>
                  <p>And to make a fuller diſcovery, we ſhall not much trouble our ſelves with the various acceptations or uſes of the word, <hi>Superſtition:</hi> Whether it is derived from <hi>Supra ſtatutum,</hi> or <hi>Supra ſtare,</hi> it matters but little, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we can arrive to the due knowledge of the thing intended by that word: which men have endeavoured of late to render very uncertain and mutable, as their ſeveral opinions, and fears, and intereſts of Religion lead them. But undoubtedly, Superſtition is a Religious Paſſion of the mind, as Atheiſm is a Paſſion of the Inferiour Senſes, and a Stupidity of the Mind, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> now cited, truly tearms it. Now, what Paſſion can it be ſo properly called as Fear in exceſs; and Fear not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Man but God; not cowardiſe, but confuſion: It may be anſwerable to the deſcription given us by the Wiſeman in theſe words: <hi>Wickedneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi>

                     </gap>.] The Latine word which we retain in our Language, <hi>Superſtition,</hi> comes very much ſhort in ſignificancie to the Greek: For that implyeth in it both the Act of him that is ſuperſtitious, and the Object about which ſuch Superſtition is uſed. And that is a Fear, of ſomewhat of the nature or eſteem of God, <hi>Daemons.</hi> Whis is not much amiſs: For though Evil Spirits or Good Spirits being the object of our Worſhip inevitably turn it into Superſtition, yet may there be Superſtition in the <hi>manner</hi> of Worſhip, as well as in the <hi>Object,</hi> when a man worſhips the true Object, God, in an undue manner. But the Latin word <hi>Superſtition</hi> ſeems to import no more than an errour in the choice of our Object, which it maketh to be ſomewhat ſuperviving, even beyond our

Senſes or common Reaſon: Such as were the Spirits of men dead, and yet believed to be alive in their ſouls, and honoured either for their great vertues, or the ſervent affection the ſuperſtitions perſon bare to him in his life time. And thus <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> took the meaning of the word not amiſs; however <hi>Lactantius</hi> rejected this account, I ſuppoſe, becauſe it was too narrow to contain the whole Evil of Superſtition, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates to the irregular manner of ſerving God, as well as to the thing we worſhip. For certainly there is a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Superſtition, and an <hi>Athenian:</hi> and the one we find reprehended by our Saviour Chriſt in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where he accuſes them for admiring and preferring their own Traditions before Gods expreſs and more neceſſary Laws: and <hi>Laying</hi>

The like to which if any ſtomacher of Eccleſiaſtical Preſcriptions and Conſtitutions could in the leaſt degree of probability prove to be either done, or intended by Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies and Orders, they had all the reaſon in the world to ſtand it out, as they do, to the utmoſt, and contend reſolutely for the Faith and pure Worſhip ſo endangered: but this being impoſſible to be made good, as will by and by appear, it will there alſo appear that Superſtition as properly pertaineth to them as any other. The <hi>Athenian</hi> Superſtition, or <hi>Gentile</hi> ignorant of the true God is that which giveth Religious Worſhip to an Object uncapable thereof; which was that St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns them for in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too ſuperſtitious: viz.</hi> for their infinite and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<note place="margin">Acts 17. 22.</note> ſollicitude in multiplying objects of Divine Worſhip, when in truth there was but one. And this is the moſt ancient ſenſe of Superſtition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentiles, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> noteth, ſpeaking thus: <hi>The Atheiſt is he, who acknowledges no God: But he is ſuperſtitious who</hi>

&amp;c. declaring unto us the dangerous Superſtition of engaging in ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for which there is no ground to be ſeen in his Word, but only in the vain and fleſhly mind of man, which is curious in ſearching into that which is not made known to him of God, and to pleaſe himſelf in ſuch bold inventions. This certainly is Superſtition.</p>
                  <p>But this is not only Superſtition, but that alſo which invents an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial form of Worſhip, to the prejudice of that truly divine and ordained: and may truly be diſtinguiſhed into two parts, both of which retain with them inſeparably the neceſſary ingredient of Fear exceſſive and needleſs. And the one is a Fear of omitting ſomething judged neceſſary to be done, though in truth it be not: The other is, a Fear as vain and groundleſs of committing ſomething neceſſarily to be avoided, as either unlawful in it ſelf, or interdicted of God, when there is no ſuch matter, though he be loudly told there is. Both theſe are really Superſtitions, the firſt <hi>Poſitive,</hi> and the latter <hi>Negative:</hi> being both influenced from Conſcience, which terrifies the one to do, and deters the other from doing, without cauſe, not without ſuſpicion or preſumption. For Conſcience taken in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſenſe, cannot be affected but at the apprehenſion of <hi>Apparent</hi> Good or Evil at the leaſt. And if this be but only an <hi>Apparence,</hi> and not a <hi>Reality,</hi> then is the conſcience miſtaken, and falls into ſuperſtitious acts, and places Religion in thoſe things which are not capable of ſuch high acts. Thus, for inſtance, If a man ſhould aſcribe as much to the worſhip of the Body given to God, as he doth to the Soul or Heart, he were undoubtedly ſuperſtitious in exceſs. And on the other ſide, if a man, having heard much of the excellencie of Spiritual Worſhip above out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Viſible, ſhould think ſo contemptibly of this and all acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as unlawful and ſinful, or ſuperſtitious, without doubt he were notoriouſly guilty of Superſtition: Why? Becauſe, according to his own principles and phraſe, he places Religion where God hath not; and makes a conſcience of that which God no where willeth him to do: but rather contrariwiſe, adviſeth him to comply with, though not by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular expreſs Law, by general and implicite. Firſt requiring as really, though not ſo primarily, bodily acts and outward reverence, as inward and ſpiritual. Secondly, by endowing his Subſtitutes, Governours Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical with ſuch power, as we have before proved to belong to the Church by Gods conceſſion. And this agrees very well with the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived definition of Superſtition amongſt Chriſtians, till of very late years, when men having a mind to ſecure their own ſtake, and to blaſt and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the opinions of ſuch as think otherwiſe than they do, fanſied and framed to themſelves definitions of that and other things, as might beſt agree with their own perſwaſions, and impugn their Adverſaries. By which unlearned and unjuſt proceedings, they groſly define Superſtition by Popery, it may be, or ſomewhat elſe they diſlike anſwerably, and <hi>Popery</hi> by <hi>Superſtition:</hi> or a little more regularly, not more truly, by <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip</hi> or <hi>Humane Inventions:</hi> for which there appear (at leaſt to them) no grounds in the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>But this they are miſtaken much in, as well in reſpect of the Rule, by which they would try and condemn Superſtition, as of the Cauſe, <hi>Humane Prudence,</hi> which they will have no otherwiſe termed than <hi>Humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> when it ſutes not with their pleaſure, which is too commonly called called Conſcience. For the Scripture hath no where tyed up Chriſtian Authority ſo ſtrictly, as not to permit it to interpoſe in any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:55232:289"/>
the Worſhip of God, without ſpecial and manifeſt warrant from thence. But the contrary is moſt certain, that it hath granted ſo much Liberty to Chriſtian Churches, as to faſhion themſelves, and modellize their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, without fear of incurring the violation of it, or, the offence of God, ſo far as manifeſt reſtraints and inhibitions do not appear to the contrary.

                     <hi>viz. To oppoſe what God never oppoſed, I muſt tell you, is more raſhneſs and arrogance than is fit for man: But let us conſtantly hold to this, that the Authority of God is uſurped, when that is condemned which he hath permitted.</hi> They therefore who ſet their Conſciences againſt thoſe things (be they Rites, Ceremonies, or Traditions, by good Eccleſiaſtical Authority enjoyned) which God hath no where forbidden, do certainly fall into flat Superſtition, and that as themſelves deſcribe it, though not intend it. For they, without Gods word, frame to themſelves Fears and Scruples; They (as the Prophet ſaith) <hi>Fear where no fear is,</hi> creating Good and Evil out of their own heads, and at their own pleaſures; yea contrary, very often, to the expreſs general Licence and Warrant of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Humane Inventions are much cryed out againſt, and made very formidable to ſuch ſuperſtitious fearful Heads, they are to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to be willing to underſtand, what we can ſcarce think them ſo weak as not to be able to underſtand; How that in no place either of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, or the New Teſtament, <hi>Inventions of Men</hi> are uſed in an evil ſenſe, but as they imply ſomewhat rather <hi>contrary to,</hi> then <hi>beſides</hi> the Divine Precepts. Sometimes they are uſed for groſs defection from Gods preſcribed Worſhip, and for Idolatrous Superſtition; and ſometimes for opinions and practiſes inconſiſtent with Gods Law; as the Traditions of the Jews condemned by Chriſt in the Goſpel. And what is all this, to thoſe uſances againſt which, after more then an hundred years eager ſearch of the Scripture to this evil intent, nothing hath been found or alledged contrary to them; But general exceptions tinctur'd ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with Scripture phraſes to no real effect? There is no more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humane Invention than this their fundamental Maxim, <hi>Nothing muſt be commanded by Man which is not commanded by God:</hi> and, <hi>It is againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty to obey Lawful Superiours, but where they ſhow Scripture par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for what they command:</hi> whereas the truth is, theſe ought, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all reaſon and good conſcience, to produce ſufficient teſtimonies of Scripture exempting them from ſubmiſſion, under the guilt of diſobedience and ſuperſtition too, both plainly condemned by God in his Word, before they oppoſe themſelves to Authority.</p>

The Papiſts have ſundry Intolerable ſuperſtitions next to Idolatry; of theſe we ſpeak not: They have likewiſe many ancient and laudable Rites and Ceremonies, innocent in themſelves, and very uſeful to Chriſtians, being not extolled above their Nature and Office; which are to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to, and not to domineer over the more material part of Religion, to the extinguiſhing or oppreſſing of it.

But to rip up this ſore diſeaſe at the Core, we ſhall ſee ſo little Religion in the tempers of theſe obſtinately ſuperſtitious people, that there will appear nothing of common reaſon, juſtice or ingenuity at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all: For ſtriking into mens minds &amp; hearts the ſparks of their dividing and factious principles, as men do fire into a Tinder-box, when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo much of their ends, as by the flames they raiſe to undo and deſtroy others and enlighten themſelves, and become powerful and glorious, they preſently cover thoſe miſchievous ſparks and put them quite out, denying they teach or hold any ſuch things; eaſily foreſeeing they muſt needs have the ſame effect upon themſelves as they had upon others, if they be ſuffered to blaze out, as they did when they lighted their Candles: Yet ſo again, that they reſerved to themſelves the ſame inſtruments and means of kindling new flames to their advantage, when their Intereſt ſhall ſo require it.

                     <hi>of Men: nor be carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines:</hi> Nor worſhip God ſo <hi>as he never commanded them, neither came it into his heart.</hi> Alas, if they would but keep themſelves faithfully and entirely to theſe Laws, which with ſo much rigour and zeal they exact from others, they muſt let go their hold, not of Ceremonies and orders meerly deviſed by themſelves, but the greateſt part of their Doctrines and Worſhip wherein they differ from us. And the time will once certainly come when we ſhall not only with confidence, but with the greateſt comfort expect the full deciſion of theſe unchriſtian Controverſies: For as St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold the Lord</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude v. 14, 15.</note>

                  <p>I ſhall end all this with one or two inſtances of their Superſtition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to erable rigour, who loudly tax the Church therewith. They have often charged the Church with Idolatrous Superſtition in propounding and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctizing Adoration towards the Eaſt: And <hi>Voetius</hi> (who hath another dogme for the Puritans comfort, <hi>viz. That preciſeneſs can no wayes be ſeparated from</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Voetius Diſp. Part. 3. de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatr. In dic. th. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>true Religion</hi>) hath alſo ſaid, <hi>That it is a ſort of Idolatry, by interpretation, for a man that prayeth in the Church to turn himſelf to the Eaſt, although he hath no conſideration that there is, or was the Quire, wherein Papiſts are wont to turn to the Eaſt.</hi> But what ſaith his fellow-Calviniſt <hi>Mareſius,</hi> who<note place="margin">Quo utroque aſſerto nihil abſurdius. <hi>Sam.

The evil event of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preciſe Superſtition appearing from two or three inſtances given by the Parrons of Scruples. For according to former grounds, <hi>Voetius</hi> his ſon by his Fathers inſinuations (as may well be preſumed) in a publick Diſputation at <hi>Utrect, June</hi> 7. 1643. delivered it for unlawful to wear ſhooes much longer than the foot, or horn-like. And I make great doubt whether he had any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon againſt that faſhion than a certain noted Puritan, who ſeeing me, being then a young Scholar, wear ſuch ſhooes, accoſted me in theſe very words, <hi>Why doſt thou make thy foot longer than Jeſus Chriſt hath made it?</hi> To whom I preſently anſwered in theſe words, <hi>Why doſt thou make thy hair ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Jeſus Chriſt hath made it?</hi> And in truth, I continue of this mind ſtill, that ſuch a reply is no idle anſwer to ſuch an idle ſuperſtitious queſtion. For if it ſhould be demanded, why I extend Chriſtian Liberty in the uſe of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies farther than Jeſus Chriſt hath extended it, not commanding them? I would firſt anſwer, I do not extend it farther, becauſe it is impoſſible for him, or any man elſe, to prove that Chriſt hath denyed this Liberty. For that which they imply that Chriſts command muſt go before all Chriſtian Acts or Ceremonies in his Service, is quite contrary to Chriſtian Liberty: For no Chriſtian is left to his liberty, where ſuch Laws or Precepts are delivered to him: But Chriſtian Liberty is an undetermined power of doing, or not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, within the ſphere of Good and Evil preſcribed: which power, next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, reſiding in the Heads or Governours of the Church, may reſtrain the indifferencie of inferiour Members of it. Secondly, I would anſwer, by demanding, Why they ſhorten and ſtraiten Chriſtian Liberty, naturally ſtretching it ſelf to the Poſitive, as well as the Negative part of our Religious Acts? This ſeems to me to be both Sacrilegious and Superſtitious too. And why they make it ſhorter then Jeſus Chriſt hath made it?</p>
                  <p>But I return to a ſecond Inſtance of preciſe Superſtition, by the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor defended: <hi>That it is unlawful to ſalute with a kiſs a Matron at firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, or departing from her, becauſe it is the foretaſte of Luſt: yea, to kiſs is a very ill cuſtom: And ſo after the Engliſh faſhion to ſalute all women they meet with.</hi> Thus the ſuperſtitious Preciſian; not diſtinguiſhing between a thing contrary to a ſober mans Judgment, and his Conſcience. Whatever is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or unprofitable, may be againſt the Judgment of a ſober man, but it is not therefore againſt his Conſcience: for only that can be ſaid to be againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which either is, or appears at leaſt to be morally evil. Doubtleſs a grave and ſober perſon may abhor the endleſs and witleſs faſhions, &amp; refuſe to follow them, but not out out of conſcience, becauſe they are of themſelves unlawful, but becauſe vain, uſeleſs, indecent, and perhaps incommodious, and ſo out of judgment, and if the conſequents be apparently evil.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude all with one inſtance more of the Superſtition of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the great cryers out againſt Superſtition, taken from <hi>Thomas Cartwright.</hi> They commonly deſcribe Superſtition to be a rigorous exacting that at the hands of Chriſtians, which is not neceſſary to be done: which is likewiſe to take away Chriſtian Liberty, according to their eſtimation. And with this Querie they ſuppoſe they come up ſo cloſe to you, as you ſhall not be able to deliver your ſelf out of their hands. Is it (which you require) neceſſary to Salvation? If it be anſwered, No: then again they come upon you with another expoſtulation, Why then do you enjoyn it? Hath not God left us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and thoſe difficult Laws and Precepts, and do you make the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:55232:291"/>
more ſtrait, and the yoke of Chriſt more heavy by multiplying Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Inventions? To the latter part we have already made anſwer in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, denying abſolutely what is taken here for granted, that by ſuch mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ceremonies, both for number and nature, as are of force and in uſe in our Church (fewer and clearer than any Church of Chriſt hath uſed for twelve hundred years before the Reformation lately made) the way to heaven is not at all ſtraitned or ſtopped; or the Precepts of God rendred more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and burdenſome, and not rather more light and eaſie to be obſerved, and the truly labouring Chriſtian helped and defended by them in his rode to heaven; but where ignorant heads and evil tongues have caſt infinite ſnares and horrible ſtumbling blocks in their way; and ſo it is not the ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, but the Enemies to ſuch Ceremonies, which have no other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in them but what they have with much ſtudy and art, and ill will (we thank them) deviſed, and traduced all things, not of their own invention, yet double guilt with the glorious pretexts of Gods Word and pure Spiritual Worſhip: which if you chance to be ſo profane and incredulous as to call in queſtion and bring to the Touch, you ſpoil all preſently. Again, farther, it is as neceſſary to Salvation as abſtaining from notorious ſins can make it, to obey thoſe that are over us in the Lord, in all things, againſt which no more but general and foul language (which are ſolid and godly proofs with the vulgar) can be brought, nor hath been. But to come to our intended Inſtance. Are all things, not neceſſary to Salvation, not only ſuperſtuous but ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious? What will theſe Objectours anſwer to Baptiſm of Infants, which, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, I here aim at, do hold uſeful indeed and profitable, but not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, or to exempt from the pains of damnation, yet they are due obſervers of it? They ſay, there is a ſpecial Precept of God for the ſame, and therefore perhaps, though the thing be not of it ſelf ſo neceſſary, it may become neceſſary, by vertue of ſuch a Precept. Granting all this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, which if we would contend with them, we might put them harder to it than they will be known of: But where will they find any ſuch direct or poſitive Precept that theſe Infants ought to be brought neceſſarily to Church, and be baptized in the publick Congregation? We commend their zeal, and much approve their reſolution ſo to have Baptiſm adminiſtred, that, ſeeing one end of it is to enter, and as it were, matriculate them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts Viſible, as well as Inviſible Body, the Church aſſembled; they ſeverely require this. But if nothing can be needful which is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary: and nothing ſo expedient as to be commanded by Man, which God hath not before required; who can without trembling read their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Superſtition, who under ſuch grievous Obligations endeavour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this, as <hi>Cartwright</hi> doth in theſe words: <hi>And I will farther ſay, that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cartwright <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift, <hi>page 14.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>though the Infants which dye without Baptiſm ſhould be aſſuredly damned, yet ought not the order which God hath ſet in his Church [Publick Baptiſm] be broken after this ſort.</hi> Now that the Order which he calls indeed Gods, is but the Order of the Aſſemblies ſo decreeing, is manifeſt from the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of proving this out of Scripture, and the eaſineſs of proving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary out of Reaſon, thus, from his own ſpeech: For is it poſſible for any man to conceive that God ſhould require any thing of any man, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of which ſhould damn him? He therefore that ſuppoſes that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, or any other perſon to be baptized, muſt by Gods ſevere command, be brought to Church to be baptized, if he be baptized at all, cannot ſo much as ſuppoſe that God will damn him for not being baptized at home in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: But this is here ſuppoſed by him, though, I know, not granted, that a
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:55232:292"/>
child may be damned for want of baptiſm, and yet this child muſt no where be baptized but in the ſolemnities of a Congregation. What is Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Superſtition in the height, if this be not? What is it to advance hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Conſtitutions and Orders to an equality with Divine Precepts, if this be not? to ſuffer a poor ſoul to be damn'd, rather than the Orders of their Church ſhould be broken: and to threaten and terrifie with damnation them that ſhall obſerve conſcienciouſly the Orders of other Churches? Or how come the Orders of their Churches, which have no Scripture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them (as this for inſtance hath not) to be more of Gods ſetling, than they of other Churches, no leſs conſonant thereunto than theirs? Where is the Fear of God, Reverence and Juſtice, Equity, and common Ingenuity want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Man, if not here? Such dealings as this do really deſerve our pity and prayers for them, as well as for our ſelves tormented by them: That God of his great mercy to them and us, would vouchſafe to open ſo their eyes, and affect their hearts, with ſuch a ſincere and ſober fear of God, that they may like loſt ſheep ſtraying into wild Deſarts, and in untrodden paths, at length be reduced to the Great Shepheard of their and our ſouls, making one Flock, and in one Fold of the Church, to the Glory of God, the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of themſelves, and the unſpeakable joy of the Church here, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of us all hereafter.</p>
